Hundreds of jute mill workers fell ill with cold-related illnesses until Wednesday morning as they continued their fourth-day fast-to-death.

For their 11-point demands the employees of 12 state-owned mills in five districts continued their demonization, including a wage board for them, raised salary, and payment of dues.

In Khulna, Narsingdi and Rajshahi, at least 15 staff and many others needed intravenous saline.

Workers— under CBA-Non-CBA Sangram Parishad's banner— renewed their strike on Sunday as the government failed to meet their demands despite repeated attempts to do so by December 26.

The staff are on hunger strike for the fourth time in 2019 to drive their claims forward.

Its demands include the enforcement of the 2015 National Wage and Productivity Commission Prize, payment of unpaid wages, sufficient budget allocation for the jute sector and seasonal procurement of jute, settlement of the outstanding provident fund and gratuity to retired workers, and payment of insurance benefits to deceased employees ' families.

During the hunger strike between 10 December and 14 December, Abdus Sattar, a 55-year-old Platinum Jubilee Jute Mill worker, died in Khulna and over 1,000 employees fell sick across the country on their protest grounds.",en,4.0,3.95,1.1,3.8,3.9,1.5,1.55

Donald Trump deserved to be impeached. He deserves to be convicted in the Senate.

Every president has committed high crimes and misdemeanors that could justify impeachment.

But not on these charges. Not for threatening to withhold $400 million in aid that we shouldn't have been sending to Ukraine in the first place, not as long as 38 million Americans are poor. Not for trying to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden; American voters have the right to know that the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president and his son are on the take.

Certainly not on the nonsensical count of contempt of Congress, which punished the president for the crime of using the legal system to defend himself.

Impeachment is a political process that only has legitimacy when it's bipartisan. In 1974 Democrats drafted wide-ranging articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon. They appealed to constituencies across a wide spectrum of interests: corruption, financial fraud, bribing witnesses not to testify, privacy violations, opposition to the Vietnam War.

The Nixon articles were crafted in order to attract support from Republicans. The media claims that the GOP has never been in thrall to a president as slavishly as it is to Trump but people who remember Nixon know better. Still, Nixon's hold on Capitol Hill Republicans eroded as the latter realized they could no longer defend conduct like his wiretapping of and siccing the IRS on political opponents.

Nancy Pelosi's microaggression-based articles of impeachment against Trump couldn't peel away a single House Republican.

Here are the articles of impeachment I would have drafted instead.

1. Racist foreign policy. President Donald J. Trump's comportment as head of state and top official in charge of foreign policy has brought shame, contempt and opprobrium upon the United States of America. He has used his Twitter feed and spoken comments in order to insult foreign heads of state and call them names. A brazen racist, he has referred to sovereign nations in Africa, and Haiti, as ""shithole countries."" If the U.S. should set the highest standard of conduct, Trump's sets the lowest, recklessly destroying our relationship with the world. Threatening to ""totally destroy"" North Korea, a nuclear power, is the kind of behavior that sparks conflicts. Few Republicans want another pointless war.

2. The President may be psychotic. The president's temperament and demeanor not only fail to rise to the bar expected of the minimal compartment of the office of President but bring disrepute upon the citizens of the United States he is tasked with representing. Anticipating the possibility that we might someday face a situation similar to that in England under King George III, the Founding Fathers conceived impeachment in large part as a way to remove a head of state who might be mentally ill, addicted to alcohol or other drugs or, in the flowery language of the time, indulge in ""frequent and notorious excesses and debaucheries, and...profane and atheistical discourses."" A president not in full command of his mental faculties is an albatross; his tenure represents a threat to national security. Under the War Powers Act, the president has the right to deploy troops. He may decide whether a condemned prisoner is pardoned or executed. He can unilaterally order a nuclear attack without provocation. Although it is impossible to determine whether President Trump is mentally ill or under the influence of narcotics, his behavior is so unsteady that it is only prudent to plan for the worst and remove him before he causes a catastrophe. Republicans know he is dangerous.

3. He endorses murder. After the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its consulate in Istanbul, President Trump repeatedly sided with the murderers. ""We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" Trump said. The president's statements makes it impossible for other countries to take us seriously when we pontificate about human rights. Republicans cannot and do not find what happened to Khashoggi acceptable.

4. He endorses fascism. After white nationalists and other bigots gathered at a violent right-wing rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulting in the murder of a peaceful progressive activist, President Trump pretended there was equivalence between neo-Nazis and anti-fascist protesters. There ""were very fine people, on both sides,"" he said. No there weren't. Hundreds of thousands of American soldiers died fighting fascism during World War II. President Trump dishonors them and increases the chances that fascism will rise again. Republicans do not agree with neo-Nazis.

5. He is lining his own pockets at the public trough. Call it ""emoluments"" if you want to make voters' eyes glaze over, call it what it is if you want to speak plainly: bribery. Trump has visited his own properties 400 times, filling rooms at full price with his retinue at taxpayer expense. Saudi Arabia has bailed out his failing hotels. He even suggested his own resort at the site of a G-8 summit. When foreign officials pay our president, they are buying influence. Republicans wouldn't tolerate this behavior from their employees. The president is our employee.

6. He kidnaps children and loses them. The Trump Administration forcibly separated 5,400 kids from the parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Many were locked in cages. After federal courts ordered them returned to their parents, the White House admitted that they couldn't locate them. They were lost. Thousands may be never be reunited with their families due to neglect and bureaucratic incompetence. Trump has asked for two years to find them. Even anti-immigration Republicans do not agree with stealing people's kids.

Next Page 1 | 2","In order to understand the great impeachment charade, it’s important to keep three facts about the strange bird known as the United States uppermost in mind.

The first is that the US is the ultimate law-based society, one whose structure derives entirely from a single four-thousand-word document created in 1787. The second is that while Americans think of the Constitution as the greatest plan of government known to man, it’s actually the opposite: a grotesque pre-modern relic that grows more unrepresentative and unresponsive with each passing year. A pro-rural Electoral College that has overridden the popular vote in two of the last five presidential elections; a lopsided Senate that allows the majority in ten urban states to be outvoted four-to-one by the minority in the other forty; lifetime Supreme Court justices who can veto any law at variance with an ancient constitution that only they understand – it’s a broken-down old rattletrap in need of a top-to-bottom overhaul. Yet it’s so thoroughly frozen that structural reform is all but unthinkable.

The third thing to keep in mind is that as the constitutional system grows more and more undemocratic, the two-party system that grew out of it in the nineteenth century grows more undemocratic as well. The result is a bipartisan race to the right. Sometimes, the Republicans seem to be in the lead as Trump imprisons thousands of immigrants fleeing murderous conditions in Central America that the US war on drugs helped create. Other times it’s the Democrats as they beat the drums for imperialist war against Russia.

Take all these factors – xenophobia, mindless obeisance to ancient law, a president imposed against the popular will, etc. – mix thoroughly, place in a super-hot oven due to a growing imperial crisis, and impeachment is what pops out. The process itself is very old, a by-product of fourteenth-century Anglo-Norman law. (Impeachment derives from the Old French empeechier, meaning to ensnare or entrap.) The British abandoned it in the late eighteenth century when Edmund Burke wasted seven years impeaching an Indian colonial governor named Warren Hastings on grounds of corruption. (The House of Lords finally acquitted him in 1795). But then the Americans took it up and now, two centuries later, are immersed in the same brainless exercise.

The results were all too evident in mid-December when one Democrat after another took to the House floor to denounced Donald Trump for violating the ancient constitution by withholding lethal military aid from the neo-Nazis of the Ukraine’s Azov Battalion.

“We used to stand up to Putin and Russia – I know the party of Ronald Reagan used to,” declared Adam Schiff, the Democratic point man on impeachment, his voice quivering with emotion. The fight to defend the Ukraine is “about more than Ukraine. It’s about us. It’s about our national security. Their fight is our fight. Their defense is our defense…. And when the President sacrifices our interests, our national security for his election, he is sacrificing our country for his personal gain.”

This was the Democratic line in a nutshell. In order to safeguard the ancient republic at home, the US must pay foreign satraps to defend its imperial interests abroad. Since no patriotic American could possibly disagree, any and all problems must stem from meddling by the evil dictator Vladimir Putin and his traitorous puppet in the Oval Office. Americans must therefore fulfill the ancient law by impeaching him just as the “founding fathers” would have wanted. Only then will peace and freedom return to the land of the free and the home of the brave.

It’s all quite ridiculous, but what’s even more bonkers is that millions of Americans think it’s true. Trump is meanwhile in his element. Now that Democrats have voted to impeach him in the House, he’d like nothing more than a lengthy trial in the Senate because (a) acquittal in the upper house is a certainty and (b) it will allow the Republican majority to put the torturers to the rack by subpoenaing everyone from Joe and Hunter Biden to Adam Schiff himself and declaring them in contempt of Congress if they refuse to testify. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has described an all-out Senate war as “mutual assured destruction,” and he’s right since, once unleashed, the ancient constitutional machinery will grind everything to dust in its path.

American politics will grow only more farcical. If Putin looms larger and larger on the world stage; if “the moment has come,” as the Times Literary Supplement recently announced, “for even the most hardened skeptics to admit that he is one of the most successful world leaders of our era”; if the US at the same time staggers from one imperial disaster to another even while descending into civil war – then it’s not because the Russian leader is particularly clever, but because the US is locked in an ancient mindset that is increasingly divorced from reality. It’s lost in a constitutional labyrinth of its own making, and impeachment is leading it deeper and deeper into the maze.",en,1.285714286,2.142857143,1.095238095,2.761904762,2.285714286,2.238095238,2.047619048

This government will set out a moderate Aristocracy: it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will in its operation produce a Monarchy, or a corrupt tyrannical --Aristocracy; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other ... George Mason's Objections to the Proposed Federal Constitution, June 18, 1788.

We the ""people"" now have the opportunity and the duty to prove Mr. Mason wrong. An impartial presidential impeachment trial now might well lead us toward a more honest, responsive body of civil officers and possibly even a less militaristic foreign policy. This is the first of a series of articles dealing with the flaws in our present impeachment trial system and the actions we might take to improve it before it is next called into use. In considering our present duty regarding impeachment, we can benefit from the words of James Madison, sometimes called the ""Father"" of our Constitution. He wrote on Oct. 15, 1788 (thirteen months into ratification) ""The great desiderata on a Court of Impeachment are 1. Impartiality, 2. Respectability (credibility): the first in order to a right the second in order to a satisfactory decision... James Madison, Observations on Jefferson's Draft of a Constitution for Virginia

This article first looks at democracy through the words of a philosopher. Next it quotes three prominent framers on impeachment. Then it comments on the political nature of our two presidential impeachment trials. Finally, it suggests the use of The Senate Impeachment Rules as the means of securing an impartial trial in 2020. Subsequent articles will suggest specific changes in the Senate Rules'

A Philosopher's Comment on Democracy

The 17th C. French Philosopher (and mentor to James Madison) Baron Charles de Montesquieu believed that the democratic form of government has an ""Inherent"" weakness in that it gives to its people the final power over their government (on ""parchment""), but fails to give them an effective way to control their civil officers. According to de Montesquieu, Kings control their civil officers by rewarding loyalty with titles. Dictators control theirs by punishing disloyalty with death. Perhaps the Framers of our democracy intended to put us, the people, in the places of kings and dictators. Instead, however, they gave us abstractions and ""parchment."" The people of democracies have their power in name only. The coming impeachment trial gives us another opportunity to devise a remedy to what de Montesquieu called democracy's ""inherent weakness:"" the great difficulty of creating a body of honest civil officers dedicated to our (the people's), even more than their own, best interests.

Hamilton on Impeachment

Hamilton submitted a statement of ""principles"" on Monday, June 18, 1787 (about three weeks after the Convention began). It read, in part, ""The Governour, Senators and all officers of the United States to be liable to impeachment for mal and corrupt conduct and, upon conviction, to be removed from office and disqualified for holding any office of trust or profit - - - all impeachments to be tried by a court to consist of the Chief . . . or Judge of the superior Court of Law of each State. Between June and September, he changed his mind about the judiciary. During the last few days of the Convention, he proposed (and secured approval of) the Senate as the trier of impeachments. During the ratification period, Hamilton published Federalist 65 and 66 supporting the Senate as the trier of impeachments.

Madison on Impeachment

Madison quoted de Montesquieu in Federalist No. 47 and elsewhere. He evidently took de Montesquieu's warnings seriously when the Baron wrote about (1) the dangers of mixing the powers of government and (2) the ""inherent"" weakness of democracies. He must have regarded Hamilton's insistence on the Senate as the trier of impeachments as a double blunder. It both violated the separation of powers principle and missed an opportunity to strengthen the impeachment provisions in response to de Montesquieu's criticism of democracies. Madison opposed Senate impeachment trials from the first to the last days of the Convention. James Madison's Notes of the Constitutional Convention for Sept. 8 (The Convention ended on Sept.16th) read, in part. ""Mr. Madison objected to a trial of the President by the Senate, especially as he was to be impeached by the other branch of the legislature . . . He would prefer the Supreme Court for the trial of impeachments, or rather a Tribunal of which that should form a part"".

Monroe on Impeachment

Our 5th President, James Monroe, writing during the five years between the end of his second term and his death, was optimistic about the ability of our impeachment provisions to maintain an honest body of civil officers. He wrote, in The People The Sovereigns (p. 16): ""The right of impeachment and of trial by the legislature is the mainspring of the great machine of government. . . If preserved in full vigor and exercised with perfect integrity, every branch will perform its duty and the people will perform theirs."" The willingness of Monroe and Hamilton to entrust impeachment trials to the legislative branch may be explained, in part, by their taking a monarchy (England) as their model.

Our Constitution and Impeachment

The reports of our two presidential trials indicate that our Constitution's presidential impeachment system is malfunctioning in a serious way. That is, it is functioning politically spite the fact that our senators and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are sworn to make it function impartially. In large part because of this failure, it has also been a dismal failure at discouraging presidential violations of our Constitution. It is impossible to say how much of our present government's chaos is due to the failure of the impeachment provisions. We do know, however, that our framers relied on them to motivate the civil officers of the three branches to dedicate themselves to our interests above their own. We also know that the Americans of the 18th C. could not anticipate the two-party system or the 17th Amendment of 1913. If they had, it seems unlikely that they would have trusted the Senate to vote impartially..

There were a few mistakes with spelling and grammar, etc., so I’ve cleaned it up, while providing annotations, links and illustrations. In regard to the entire milieu of high-grade Freemasonry during the Enlightenment, the Philalèthes are as noteworthy as they come. The Rite itself - more of a regime - and the Lodge ‘Amis Réunis’ from which it was founded, constituted a clearing house for all things occult or esoteric on the continent and beyond; Savalette de Langes and the Marquis de Chefdebien may even be described as engaging in Masonic espionage. There isn’t a single volume on 18th Century Freemasonry that doesn’t give the major details of the Amis Réunis and the Philalèthes. Members of the rite came not only from France, but from Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Sweden and Russia (and as was shown with the publishing of J. J. C. Bode’s diary in 1994, the Bavarian Illuminati had managed to officially join forces with it just two years before the revolution). I’ve read more than a few accounts of the Philalèthes over the years, but this report by Frick - about as complete an introduction as as you’ll find - is by far the best. *** › Continue reading

Lodge of Les Amis Réunis [The United Friends] Tuesday, August 25th, 2009 | Freemasonry, Philalèthes | 2 Comments We’ll be mentioning this famous Lodge in Paris in forthcoming posts. What follows is a concise explanation of its operation and makeup (translated from a French Masonic Encyclopedia entry by Pierre François Pinaud). *** Amis Réunis From 1771 to 1791, this lodge was one of the most prestigious in Paris and was consecrated by the Keeper of the Royal Treasury Savalette de Langes. Initially formed abroad in Rumigny, a small town of Thiérache, by a magistrate of the Parliament of Paris (banished by Chancellor Maupeou), in 1773 the lodge settled permanently in Paris. Savalette de Langes had made the inner circle of the Amis Réunis the social center of modern Freemasonry and cosmopolitanism of the late Enlightenment. Here the elite and and the talented joined together. The orchestra of the Amis Réunis was composed of six musicians of renown, like the composer [Isidore] Bertheaume, the brothers Blasius, the King’s violinists, Boutray of the l’Académie [Royale] de Musique, and either the brothers Breval or Louis Francoeur, the King’s Superintendent of Music. The Lodge utilized a large space in a house in the Rue Popincourt, built in 1708 by the architect Dulin for the supplier of arms [Nicholas?] Dunoyer. Upon his death in 1791, Les Amis Réunis counted some 300 members with a further 37 casual brothers and brother servants. It comprised about 12% foreigners, such as the Baron de Beutz, chancellor of Saxony; the Baron de Gleichen, Minister of Denmark in Madrid, Naples and Paris; and Count Stroganoff, a Russian subject. A hundred senior officers or generals decorate the pillars, and about fifteen of their regiment. Painters and sculptors are well represented with a dozen doctors, all members of the Academy of Medicine or professors at the University of Paris - Monge was an assiduous member of the lodge for some years. But the Amis Réunis’ uniqueness is the significant number of its members who belonged to the world of finance: 37% of the Lodge in total, 84 people, were indeed financiers. We count no fewer than 15 bankers or speculators, 13 receiver generals, 7 tax collectors [fermiers généraux], 7 general treasurers including those of the Navy and War, 4 general paymasters, 19 members of the Courts of Finances of Paris, 7 senior officials of the Royal treasury and finally, 11 brothers who were occupied with public finance. On the eve of the Revolution, the lodge of the Amis Réunis had the highest concentration of financiers; a number of them met in groups, or independently, to engage in speculative ventures. We also find Lodge members as shareholders of the arms factory in Charleville, the Water Company in Paris, and the mines at Baïgorry, Decize or Rueil. Another group actively participated in speculation about the dollars held by the bank St. Charles de Madrid. Others are shareholders of the Hudson Bay Company that traded with Canada. Many specialize in international commerce, and others with India or the islands trading sugar and rum, but also the slave trade. At the famous East India Company, one finds Lodge members as shareholders or as administrators. A last group is actively involved in real estate speculation in Paris. The success of the Amis Réunis in the financial world may be explained by the fact that, in the latter third of the 18th-century, in the absence of public credit, only powerful financiers could undertake large scale financial transactions. Everything is then prefaced upon trust. This leads to the membership of professional lobbyists, and familial networks which are found in the Lodge. The trustworthiness of Masonic affiliation may result in more business, which enables both administrators and profiteers. The Lodge therefore offered a discreet setting for financial conversations and the development of protective relationships; philosophical bonds are then the natural extension in the world of finance.

The So-Called Schwedenkiste (“Swedish Box”), the Most Significant Illuminati Archive Wednesday, June 17th, 2009 | Primary Documents | 7 Comments by Terry Melanson (17/6/2009) After Adam Weishaupt had fled in 1785, the center of activity for the Illuminati shifted from Bavaria to the Duchies of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar. And while the founder of the Illuminati was content to safely settle down for the long haul at the court of Duke Ernst II of Saxe Gotha, Johann Joachim Christoph Bode (1730-1793) took the reins and assumed the role previously held by Weishaupt. Through the efforts of Bode and an expanding network of recruits – and under the protection of the Illuminati Dukes Karl August of Saxe-Weimar and Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha – new colonies were established in places like France, Russia and Italy. Bode kept the Weimar and Gotha Lodges Amalia and Ernst Zum Kompass informed of his activities, but the bulk of the evidence of continued Illuminati activity remained in his possession. Ensuring that whatever they contained would remain secret, upon Bode’s death in December 1793 his literary executor, Illuminatus Christian Gottlieb von Voigt (1743–1819), transferred his deceased friend’s possessions to Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha who had already bought the voluminous papers before Bode died. › Continue reading

“Master Conspiracy” Redux Monday, June 15th, 2009 | Illuminati myths | 9 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/6/2009) The New American website has posted a slightly redacted version of William H. McIlhany’s 1996 article which appeared in the September 16, 1996 issue of The New American. (The original can be read here, which, in turn, appears to be based on one of McIlhany’s presentations). I first became aware of McIlhany’s writings on the Illuminati in 2000. At the time I was very impressed by what I read, and immediately realized that his information on the real Bavarian Illuminati was more thorough than most. However, my own knowledge on the subject is a bit more advanced than it was some nine years ago. So with that in mind, here are some exaggerations and/or misrepresentations which struck me as I reread the article at The New American for the first time in years. “Kölmer” and the Origin of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of the Illuminati According to McIlhany, Weishaupt was “instructed by a mysterious occultist named Kölmer.” The only problem I have with this statement is that it is not qualified with “alleged” or “purported.” The Kölmer legend first appeared in Volume III of Abbé Augustin Barruel’s tome against Philosophes, Freemasons, the Illuminati and the Jacobins. He related it rather tentatively as a rumour going round, and as a possible way of explaining the ostensibly advanced nature of Weishaupt’s mysteries. › Continue reading

“Lang” or “Lanz”: Myths about the “Myths” Saturday, November 15th, 2008 | Illuminati myths | 4 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/11/2008) So, I’m browsing through the results of a keyword-search (targeting blogs) that I had previously saved as an RSS feed in Google Reader - “Illuminati.” Usually the results point to sites that abuse the term as a mere descriptor for an overarching, all-powerful monolithic conspiracy. However, once in a while, I occasionally come across at least an attempt not to knowingly butcher the historical record. The November 12th post at the English section of Illuminaten.org is one such example. But as I started reading “The Bavarian Illuminati: several myths revealed,” it became quite clear that the post is, in fact - word for word - an abridged re-posting of “A Bavarian Illuminati Primer.” Once I got to the part about Lanz and Lang, I knew for sure. Here’s what Mason Trevor W. McKeown thinks is the myth/truth: As an example of the mythology that surrounds the history of the Illuminati, note that Barruel claimed that Lanz, an Illuminati courier and apostate priest, was struck by lightning, thus revealing Weishaupt’s papers to the authorities, but this does not appear to be substantiated. This error was widely reprinted and enlarged on by subsequent anti-masons whose lack of research and disdain for historical accuracy has lead them to confuse Johann Jakob Lanz (d.1785), a non-Illuminati secular priest in Erding, and friend of Weishaupt, with Franz Georg Lang, a court advisor in Eichstätt who was active in the Illuminati under the name Tamerlan. Barruel mistakenly translated “weltpriester”, or secular priest, as apostate priest and subsequent writers such as Webster and Miller have repeated this error. Eckert renamed Weishaupt’s friend as Lanze and had him struck by lightning while carrying dispatches in Silesia. Miller cited Eckert but renamed Lanz as Jacob Lang and placed the lightning strike in Ratisbon. This is a minor detail in the history but it demonstrates the lack of accuracy often displayed by detractors of the Illuminati. As nobody has challenged him on these assertions - not even a German site who should know better - I’ll reiterate and add additional information to what I had written back in August 2005. Mr. McKeown is guilty of the same thing he accuses others of: “lack of research and disdain for historical accuracy.” › Continue reading

Illuminati Sightseeing: Karl and St. Germain at Louisenlund Monday, November 10th, 2008 | Illuminati Sightseeing | 2 Comments by Terry Melanson (10/11/2008) The estate of (Illuminatus) Landgrave Karl von Hessen-Kassel (1744-1836) was an occult-masonic initiatory retreat. The world’s foremost expert on the 18th-Century Golden and Rosy Cross, Dr. Christopher McIntosh: The head of the Asiatic Brethren in the 1780s and 1790s was the Landgrave Carl von Hessen-Kassel, one of the most fascinating and influential figures at the time in the world of Masonry, Rosicrucianism and hermetic studies. He not only belonged to innumerable orders and rites, but he was a practicing alchemist and was a friend of the mysterious French alchemist, the Comte de St. Germain, whom he harbored during the last years of St. Germain’s life on his estate Louisenlund in what is now Schleswig-Holstein, which he turned into a great center of Masonic and esoteric activity. The park at Louisenlund (about an hour’s drive northwest of Kiel) was laid out in the form of an initiatic journey that involved the candidate passing through a dense wood finding his way through a labyrinth and encountering various alchemical and allegorical images along the way. In the park was an alchemist’s tower with a laboratory and a room where Masonic rituals were conducted. There was also a pond with a secret grotto concealed behind a waterfall, in which the most solemn rituals were held. Over the years, unfortunately, most of these symbolic features have disappeared. All that remains of the alchemist’s tower, for example, is this Egyptian stone doorway which was moved to a different position, and cemented into the wall of a stable building where it stands completely out of context. Today this property belongs to a private school. › Continue reading",en,3.5,3.833333333,3.666666667,3.833333333,4.0,3.666666667,2.666666667
3,1496319912_1484176935,"× Expand Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP Abortion bans, like the one signed into law by Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp, restrict the circumstances under which a woman can access abortion.

The new year brings a fresh start for many state legislatures and a return to old battles over abortion access: 2019 proved to be a watershed year for conservative states seeking to limit abortion access as they competed to craft a law that would force a Supreme Court challenge. The idea that Roe v. Wade might finally be struck down by a more conservative Supreme Court fueled the passage of nine early-abortion bans in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Utah.

Abortion restrictions and their outsize impact on poor women of color are not new. What is new is how anti-abortion proponents are appropriating historic and progressive legal victories and using medical disinformation in their attempts to enact these early-abortion bans. As statehouses with a majority of anti-abortion legislators reconvene in 2020, these laws will continue to proliferate. We researched the arguments and the language Georgia lawmakers and community members used to pass a “heartbeat bill,” HB 481. The Georgia law bans abortions upon detection of possible fetal cardiac activity, often around six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant.

Abortion bans, like the one signed into law by Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp, restrict the circumstances under which a woman can access abortion so that the procedure is effectively prohibited. Although the ban won’t go into effect on January 1, thanks to a temporary injunction by a federal judge, supporters of reproductive rights can’t rest easy. With nearly 75 percent of women who access abortions living below the federal poverty level, the ban in Georgia and other states would disproportionately hurt low-income groups, pregnant people of color, and young people.

Supporters of the abortion ban asserted that fetuses are a class of persons entitled to equal protection under the 14th Amendment. They compared Roe v. Wade’s treatment of fetuses to the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted slaves as partial persons for tax and census purposes. Comparing fetuses to enslaved people is particularly craven and effectively erases the historical and ongoing struggles for Black liberation. It is also deeply insulting to Black residents of Georgia.

“HB 481 is in and of itself a denial of the full humanity of the very people who would be forced to be pregnant against their will … many of whom will inevitably be Black women,” said Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director of Atlanta’s Feminist Women’s Health Center, who attended the March 2019 hearings. “We will not accept any law that invalidates our humanity in an effort to assign humanity to what is growing inside our bodies.”

HB 481 supporters also used terms that described fetuses as “early infants” or “child in utero”—vocabulary which does not exist in medicine. Medical evidence was grossly misrepresented, for example, conflating fetal viability with viable pregnancy. While fetal viability is influenced by numerous complex factors, viability of a fetus before 22 weeks is highly unlikely, even with extreme medical intervention. Even though beliefs about when life begins are complex, varied, and personal, the determination of fetal viability is clear under constitutional law, which recognizes a difference between fetuses in later pregnancy and six-week-old embryos.

Abortion opponents frequently use religion to support their positions, from displaying signs with Bible verses during protests outside clinics to violent extremist attacks against health providers. Yet that language was largely absent from the HB 481 debate, and religious beliefs did not appear to be explicitly driving the push for early-abortion bans. Instead, issues of oppression, marginalization, and control are.

By misrepresenting medical facts and couching their arguments within dubious constitutional frameworks, supporters of early-abortion bans are attempting to pass laws that will produce a Supreme Court challenge. If such a case reaches the high court and a majority of the justices side with abortion opponents, many women may find it difficult if not impossible to end a pregnancy in certain states.

In 2020, conservative states like South Carolina are already moving swiftly to enact restrictions that would limit reproductive autonomy and disproportionately harm poor women and women of color. Pro-choice legislators, reproductive-health researchers, and human rights and reproductive justice advocates must respond just as fast.

4,1484188850_1541521620,"A collection of Troubles-era artefacts that includes shoes reputedly owned by Colonel Muammar Gadafy is attempting to secure official museum status ahead of a major expansion.

Over the last five decades, the Roddy McCorley Society in west Belfast has amassed a large number of items related to the conflict and associated with the republican tradition.

It includes decorative shoes the Libyan dictator apparently gifted to IRA leader Joe Cahill during a visit to his North African regime to secure arms for the Provisionals.

Among the weaponry the IRA obtained from Libya were tonnes of Semtex explosive used in some of the most notorious bomb attacks of the conflict.

Nine years on from Gadafy’s death, relatives of those killed continue to campaign for compensation from the current Libyan authorities.

The Troubles collection also includes a bed and blanket from the /Maze prison and a badly damaged British army issue rifle a member of the public apparently found close to the site of the Narrow Water bombings which killed 18 soldiers in 1979.

The society has already secured Belfast City Council backing to transform the collection’s present home, in three rooms above the Roddy McCorley Social Club on the Glen Road, into a purpose-built museum facility.

As part of the process it is hoping to achieve museum accreditation. The society recently met officials from National Museums NI to discuss its ambitions.

Society committee member Kevin Carson said the official status would enable it to loan and swap artefacts with other museums throughout Ireland.

“We started in one room and then we took over a second room and now we have a third room and, even at that, we haven’t enough space to put on show all the stuff we have,” he said.

“We do look forward to getting museum status. Me and other members of the committee have travelled the length and breadth of Ireland to tie up with other groups and museums and collectors to hope in the future to actually exchange parts of our exhibitions back and forward, so stuff from Belfast could be on show in Cork or Mayo or Derry or Donegal, but we need to have proper museum status.

“We are going through the process at the moment with meeting all the groups that would be great assistance to us to turn ourselves into a museum.”

The Roddy McCorley Society was formed in 1972 as a vehicle to raise funds for the families of republican prisoners.

The collection of artefacts began with art crafted by those prisoners, such as Celtic crosses and leather wallets.

While the society tells the story of the Troubles very much through a republican prism, the collection also includes several loyalist items, donated by ex-prisoners from the other tradition who have visited as part of peace process reconciliation initiatives.

Mr Carson said Gadafy’s shoes were “very valuable” and continued to generate significant interest among visitors. A TV crew from the Middle East visited during the summer to film Mr Carson recounting the story of the shoes.

“Joe Cahill, one of our major republican personalities over the years, had been in Libya on a number of occasions to meet Gadafy and on one of the occasions he met Muammar Gadafy in the desert after a great long journey in the sun and heat and dryness, because Gadafy in those days could never stay in one spot,” he said.

“Joe on that occasion was presented by Muammar Gadafy with these slippers as a souvenir of this visit.”

The director of National Museums NI, Kathryn Thomson, said: “The story of our recent past is one that is distributed through a network of museums, visitor attractions, and tours across Northern Ireland.

“At National Museums NI we work with this network as part of the development and programming of important exhibitions such as the Troubles & Beyond at the Ulster Museum.

“Where relevant we are always willing to offer curatorial and other expert advice and support to community led initiatives.

“Within this context we welcomed the opportunity to visit the Roddy McCorley Museum recently and look forward to seeing their project develop.” – PA","The PSNI must confiscate a British soldier’s rifle reportedly taken from the scene of an IRA atrocity and now on show in a republican museum in west Belfast, an MLA has said.

UUP Justice spokesman Doug Beattie was speaking after the Roddy McCorley Society went public with its plans to secure official museum status, while displaying the remains of the rifle.

It was reportedly taken from the scene of the Narrow Water massacre in 1979. The double IRA bomb attack killed 19 soldiers in the most damaging single attack on the armed forces during the Troubles.

“This weapon must be confiscated by the PSNI to ensure all evidence has been gathered and a valid decommission certificate has been issued,” Mr Beattie said on social media. “Then it needs to be returned to MoD for disposal.”

A critic responded to him that there was “no right or wrong memorabilia”.

But Mr Beattie replied: “In the same way the Seán Graham bookies murder weapon should never be in a museum, neither should this weapon.” His critic conceded the point: “Yeah I agree with that.”

The museum also sports a pair of shoes given by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to former Belfast IRA commander Joe Cahill, who was convicted of gun running from Libya in a Dublin court in 1973.

But Jonathan Ganesh, who was seriously injured in the 1996 Canary Wharf bomb which used Libyan Semtex, condemned the exhibit. “Surely this is a sick joke?” he said.

Mr Ganesh was speaking after it was reported the collection is seeking official museum status.

The Roddy McCorley Society, based on the Glen Road in west Belfast, did not offer any comment. It is hoping to achieve museum accreditation and recently met with National Museums NI as part of the process.

Loyalist blogger and activist Jamie Bryson described the matter as “an utter outrage”.

He said: “The PSNI have spent three years seizing UVF flags, and badges and the like and holding press conferences saying they are indicative of membership of any proscribed organisation..... yet a republican museum is untouched?”

Det Chief Supt Bobby Singleton said: “Following today’s press coverage we are now aware of the existence of what is reputed to have been a weapon belonging to British Army personnel at Narrow water. We have now commenced initial enquiries with a view to establishing the veracity of these claims and what, if anything, PSNI will be legally required to do.”",en,1.052631579,2.052631579,1.052631579,2.684210526,2.157894737,1.263157895,2.526315789
5,1484037348_1484256518,"The new year starts things off right with a slew of great new comics. From DC, a Yuletide-themed serial killer is stalking the streets of Gotham City in an all-new Batman story arc, and Martian Manhunter faces off against formidable foe in order to save a town in the penultimate issue of an outstanding maxi-series.

Marvel Comics kicks off anew ongoing series taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…. We also get a new series featuring the lamest Avenger (who is actually one of the coolest), and Jonathan Hickman and Leinil Francis Yu’s flagship title in the “Dawn of X’ initiative focuses on diplomacy and all the rough business that comes with it.

5 Detective Comics #1018

By: Peter J. Tomasi, Scott Godlewski, David Baron, Rob Leigh, Rafael Sandoval, Jordi Tarragona, and John Kalisz

COMIXOLOGY

There’s a killer on the loose in Gotham City, but what else is new? Bruce Wayne’s home town has no shortage of madmen and monsters terrorizing its streets, but after a string of “festive” murders, The Dark Knight finds himself on the trail of a criminal who bases his crimes on Christmas tradition.

Writer Peter J. Tomasi and artist Scott Godlewski kick off a new story arc appropriately titled “Death of Winter,” in which the most wonderful time of the year turns deadly and the person behind the carnage has their eyes set Gotham’s favorite son.

4 Martian Manhunter #11

By: Steve Orlando, Riley Rossmo, Ivan Plascencia, and Deron Bennett

COMIXOLOGY

Despite their respective powers and fortitude, the duo of J’onn J’onzz and Diane Meade have the deck stacked against them in this penultimate issue of DC Comics’ wild, science fiction 12-issue maxi-series. The only thing standing between Char’rnn O’zzm, the charming red fellow with the winning smile, and the town of Midleton’s destruction is our titular green hero.

Martian Manhunter #11 is a reminder of why this series is so engaging. Its script is propulsive and sharp. And the artwork is kinetic and exaggerated to Tex Avery levels of insanity. This series has been so much fun for the past year, and we’re happy to see it moving toward the epic ending it deserves.

3 Hawkeye: Freefall #1

By: Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt, VC’s Joe Sabino, Kim Jacinto, and Tamra Bonvillain

COMIXOLOGY

There is a certain level of joy one gets from seeing the character of The Hood pop up in a comic book. That joy stems from the knowledge that you’re going to see a rather obnoxious villain, who everyone sells short too often, get pounded on by Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. Of course, when that doesn’t exactly happen, things get interesting.

Diving deep into the lore of Clint Barton, such as it is, Hawkeye: Freefall #1 is a fast funny story that echoes the iconic run by Matt Fraction and David Aja, but widens its net for weird and mystic elements. Writer Matthew Rosenberg and artist Otto Schmidt are clearly having a blast here and it’s hard to imagine anyone who picks this book up wouldn’t as well.

2 Star Wars #1

By: Charles Soule, Jesus Saiz, Arif Prianto, VC’s Clayton Cowles, R.B. Silva, and GURU-eFX

COMIXOLOGY

Taking place immediately after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars #1 follows Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewie after taking nearly escaping with their lives and losing Han Solo… of course, you already knew all of that. What you may not know is that once free from the Empire-controlled Cloud City, more dangers await.

With a strong script filled with wonderful characterizations of iconic Star Wars heroes, gorgeous art, and all new villain, this debut issue is a great way to kick the New Year for pop culture’s most celebrated and debated space opera.

1 X-Men #4

By: Jonathan Hickman, Leinil Francis Yu, Gerry Alanguilan, Sunny Gho, VC’s Clayton Cowles, and Tom Muller

COMIXOLOGY

Jonathan Hickman and Leinil Francis Yu’s flagship title in the “Dawn of X” fleet speeds ahead in X-Men #4. The leaders of Krakoa attend the World Economic Forum, which, on the surface, sounds like yawner of a plot. Thankfully, where the X-Men go, trouble tends to follow.

Brokering peace is no easy task, especially when one nation in that discussion is populated with characters who could potentially annihilate an entire country with their abilities. Hickman and Yu explore the idea of a country birthed in a contentious position, wherein their mere existence frightens other world leaders. Complex, well-written, and wonderfully illustrated X-Men #4 is another winner for the new state of Marvel’s mutant roster.

6,1484188482_1484068924,"David Weingard, CEO and founder of Cecelia Health, traces the beginning of his company to the day, at 36 years old, he walked into a doctor’s office and was told he had Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.

David Weingard, CEO and founder of Cecelia Health in New York City. Cecelia Health

“I had no energy, and when I stepped on the scale I was 30 pounds lighter than I expected,” Weingard said. “I was in shock, overwhelmed.”

Normally Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed at a much younger age than Weingard was at the time, but a small percentage of people are diagnosed later in life. No one knows the reason for the later onset of the disease, according to Weingard.

Weingard’s next shock came as he tried to find advice and support. Weingard was born and raised in Manhattan, where he still lives.

“I went to the local hospital and was told the next diabetes training was months away,” Weingard said. “I was fortunte to meet a great clinician named Cecelia Born-Cort, who gave me support and compassion, and inspired me.”

Born-Cort was a Diabetes Educator Clinician at Lighthouse Guild, a non-profit on West 64th Street in New York City dedicated to preventing vision loss, a common symptom of uncontrolled diabetes. Like most nurses, Born-Cort was overbooked. What made her special, Weingard said, is that she knew how important it was to help him understand and deal with his Type 1 diabetes. She made the time to fit him into her schedule.

“It’s a chronic, progressive disease,” Weingard said. “People get diagnosed and don’t realize if they don’t take the medications, or take care of themselves, there’s a high probability of a heart attack, going blind, or losing a limb.”

Cecelia Born-Cort, the Diabetes Educator Clinician who helped David Weingard, CEO of Cecelia Health. Cecelia Health

Weingard worked for Microsoft in business development at the time he was diagnosed. He was also a competitive runner and cyclist, entering Ironman competitions. Inspired by Cecelia, he decided in 2008 to leave his job at Microsoft and launch a business that would deliver the kind of help she gave him to hundreds of thousands of people across the country by leveraging technology.

Weingard named his company for Cecelia after learning she had passed away from cancer. He was able to track down her son in Atlanta, and on the company website there’s a four-minute video of an interview with him about his mother and the company she inspired.

In order to maximize the impact of Cecelia Health, Weingard realized he needed to work with pharmaceutical companies and insurance health plans. These companies pay a monthly subscription to Cecelia Health to reach out to diabetes patients and establish a level of trust that results in improved outcomes.

Weingard knew that 50 percent of patients prescribed diabetes medications don’t get their prescriptions filled and initiate treatment.

“It’s a huge problem for these pharmaceutical companies, and obviously a problem for patients,” Weingard said.

Cecelia Health has 250 clinicians who work with diabetes patients in whatever way is going to be most effective. They make it clear to patients that they are there for them whenever they’re needed, that they’re not going away, and that they’ll fit into their lives in whatever way works. If it’s best to call after the kids have gone to bed, or whenever the patient is not at work, Cecelia Health’s clinicians will do it.

“I want to be able to bring a form of Cecelia to everyone with diabetes on the planet,” Weingard said. “That form can be human, it could be a video, it could be electronic through email, in every language, whatever way people need it.”

The need for the kind of intervention Cecelia Health is providing is critical. At the end of 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 84 million Americans, roughly one-third of the population, are prediabetic, with higher than normal blood sugar levels, and are on their way to developing full-blown Type 2 diabetes.

Cecelia Health CEO David Weingard is a competitive triathlete, which he says helps him deal with his ... [+] Type 1 diabetes. Cecelia Health

As of 2015, there were about 30 million Americans with diabetes, with an additional 1.5 million people being diagnosed with the disease every year, according to the American Diabetes Association. Weingard points out there are not nearly enough endocrinologists to go around.

“There are only 3,000 endocrinologists, and most of them are on the East and West coasts,” he said. “There’s no way the math works. The center of the country is a vacuum. We’ll be able to help.”

The next big step for Cecelia Health, Weingard said, is to become a provider in every state so the company’s clinicians can write prescriptions and adjust medications – essentially a diabetes telemedicine company. He expects to have the legal framework in place some time late in 2020, and by 2021 to be able to go international.

“This mode is virtual, so we can easily do that,” Weingard said. “We’re already handling multiple languages.”

Weingard himself, at 56 years old, continues to compete in triathlons. Most days he gets in a 25-mile bicycle ride in Central Park before going to work.

“I’ll tell you for me getting up and doing that makes me feel I’m beating diabetes,” Weingard said. “I’m not that fast, but I’m taking care of myself. I changes my whole sense of empowerment.”","With our obesity rate at an all time high — nearly four in 10 Americans are not just overweight, but obese — the Food and Drug Administration is cracking down on one of our greatest social ills: flavored e-cigarettes in stores that admit minors. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce the regulations any day now.

In the latest episode of the nanny state run amok, the FDA has decided that teen vaping is its villain of the day. It is imposing heavy restrictions on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, such as a complete ban of sales in non-age-restricted facilities, like gas stations and convenience stores, as well as increased regulations for online sales.

The cigarette industry must be thrilled. A marked increase in vaping has contributed to the lowest rate of cigarette use among American adults since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began reporting on it in 1965. A quarter of smokers who successfully quit within the year are now vaping instead. Study after study demonstrates that vaping significantly increases the probability of quitting smoking, whereas other methods, like nicotine replacement therapy, do not.

Still, Gottlieb decries e-cigs because they're ""not risk-free"" and there is supposedly an ""epidemic"" of teen use. Well, considering that 1.4 million teenagers have still smoked cigarettes in the last month, I'll take a vaping epidemic over a cigarette one.

As with most things we put in our bodies, vaping does come with risks. E-cigarettes were specifically designed to wean smokers off of cigarettes, so vaping delivers nicotine. However, Public Health England found that e-cigs are only 5 percent as harmful as actual cigarettes. The research in the U.K. demonstrated that just 1 percent of all vapers picked up a regular vaping habit after never smoking before. Thus, vaping is being consistently used for its intended purpose, with very few outside consequences.

All pubic health decisions involve trade-offs. If e-cigarettes are helping millions of adults cease a practice with a 50 percent chance of killing them in the long term, that's undoubtedly worth having a tiny minority of teenagers pick up a habit that is unproven and unlikely to do much more harm than most of the American fast food industry has already done. Banning flavored vaping products in convenience stores will also harm low-income Americans trying to quit smoking more than anyone else.

Gottleib calls this an ""unfortunate tradeoff."" And it is. His decision could very well kill people by taking away the single most successful alternative to a habit that murders people en masse.

Repealing net neutrality was never going to kill anyone. Tax cuts were never going to kill anyone. Banning 70 percent of the e-cigarette supply from being sold in the cheapest, most accessible venues, however, could actually kill people.",en,2.181818182,3.636363636,3.909090909,3.681818182,3.863636364,2.318181818,3.409090909

AN UNFAMILIAR and unexpected site appeared outside Spain’s largest department store today (January 1), causing a wave of outrage in the local Spanish community.

Here a group of completely naked women were outstretched on the floor in front of El Corte Ingles in Spain’s Alicante, with what looked like blood streaming across their bodies.

-- Advertisement --





Those who witnessed the surprising scene voiced their fury on social media, with the controversial party Vox even expressing their dismay at the undressed group.

Posting a picture on Facebook, the party’s group asked: “Is it necessary for our children to witness these protests?”, evidently alarmed at the time and place the activists had planned their demonstration. They also stated that there was a police presence around the group, which seemed to anger the party even more that much needed public resources had been used to protect such an ‘outrageous demonstration’.





The post received hundreds of shares and comments, with one claiming: “Its not normal that these women are lying on the floor as if they were dead and little children are passing and watching something they can’t even understand. Mind-blowing.”



Geplaatst door VOX Alicante – Ciudad op Zondag 29 december 2019

Another simply said the act was “Shameful” whilst one user responded and said: “As a woman I am ashamed to see this, long live the freedom of expression but not this. I find it to be ridiculous and it is not something I want my children to see.”

Others made light of the situation, stating “What a way to relieve a hangover” with another stating that they should be swept up with a broom and cleared from the streets with one person agreeing that the fire brigade should “shoo them away.”

Although it is not known exactly why this ‘naked protest’ took place, some believed it to be an action from a group of activists who wanted to give visibility to gender-violence in Spain. The cases of women subject to domestic violence across the country has risen to dramatic proportions over the last few years, with many groups hoping to show the plight of abused women in a range of demonstrations.

However, the person managing the Vox Alicante Facebook account disagreed, and said that they were informed by the police that the protest was against animal cruelty, an equally alarming issue where the growing number of abused animals is now being highlighted across the country.

For those that simply do not agree that the protest was appropriate to be carried out in broad daylight on New Year’s Day, it has seemed to garner exactly the attention that it sought.","





THE National Police have confirmed that they have arrested two men for allegedly stealing almost 150 kilograms of avocados in Costa del Sol’s Malaga, Spain.

The men who were arrested, both of Spanish nationality, have been accused of raiding an avocado farm in Churriana and selling the fruit off in their own supermarket.

-- Advertisement --





Officers were alerted to the post-Christmas theft on Saturday, December 28, when a local resident reported that they had seen two men acting suspiciously on a farm and lurking around the prized avocado trees.

Attending the scene, officers found that the fences surrounding the plot of land had been partially broken and once speaking to the farmer he confirmed that a significant number of his beloved avocados had been taken. With the witness providing an excellent description of the assailants, officers were able to locate the men nearby carrying an assortment of plastic bags filled with the soiled goods.





Further investigation revealed that one of the men owned a small greengrocers in Malaga and had planned to sell the fruits in a bid to make a considerable amount of profits.

As Euro Weekly News understands, both men were charged with theft today (January 1) and are due to appear in court in due course.

Avocado theft is a particularly common problem for farmers dedicated to cultivating the fruit, largely because of their expensive price tag. In Spain, the fruit can cost anywhere up to €5 – a cost that keeps on growing due to the numerous health benefits that they are proven to hold.

A police swoop that saw dog patrols halt traffic bound for the M53 was a pre-planned operation targeting a suspected money launderer.

Vehicles were trapped in a road block after exiting the Wallasey Tunnel at around 5pm on Saturday evening.

Dramatic footage showed a man being handcuffed while on the ground after officers surrounded his car.

Dog units were among the patrols scrambled to carry out the arrest.

One witness, called Tom, said: ""After going through the tunnel the first turn-off was blocked off by two police cars so everybody was going straight towards the M53.

""As you got a mile or so up the road there was a road block. They had police blocking the road, one police car then came up the right hand side and one up the hard shoulder, it was crazy.""

Advice for women | Officers have a legal right to pull you over night or day - but know your rights

South Africa's social climate has left women and children living in a perpetually vulnerable state to the extent that safety isn't a guarantee, even when dealing with law enforcement officers - both real and fake.

The growing scourge of gender-based violence and femicide in the country has included several incidents involving law enforcement officers - those entrusted with protecting members of society.

News24 earlier reported that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) arrested a 45-year-old police sergeant on Monday after he was accused of raping an 18-year-old woman while on a church outing in Westbank, East London.

In February, a high-ranking Cape Town police officerwas accused of raping a woman he allegedly threatened to arrest for sex work.

In addition, the close of women's month saw the murder of boxing champion Leighandre ""Baby Lee"" Jegelswho was shot and killed by her estranged boyfriend - a police officer.

As we enter the festive season, women and children will inevitably be on the roads, where the police have heightened their visibility. As women living in South Africa these are your rights:

A traffic officer has the legal right to stop you and check your car registration as well as your driver's licence.

According to Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Wayne Minnaar, both male and female traffic officers have the right to stop you day or night.

Women are encouraged to comply with the officers and stop and remain inside their vehicle but immediately request to see an appointment card.

""If they do not have an appointment card then they are not an officer, I would suggest that you call for help immediately,"" he explained.

Social media has seen several incidents of women driving alone at night, opting to stop at the nearest garage or visible location while being pulled over by the police.

A recent incident in Tshwane saw awoman allegedly being manhandled by a number of Tshwane Metro Police Department officers at a petrol station in Lyttleton.

The woman feared the cops were not real and did not to pull over. She instead opted to drive to a nearby petrol station, where the officers proceeded to allegedly manhandle her.

In incidents of this nature, Minnaar could not clarify whether - in light of this country's social climate of violence against women and children - this action was justifiable or not.

""Look,it's about obeying the rules of the road and that is for everyone - male or female.

""Officers may apply their discretion in these situations, but an officer can stop you legally,"" he explained.

Women must remember the following if a police stop escalates to a search:

- A male or female officer is permitted to stop you and request your driver's licence and car registration.

- If you are pulled over and the officer decides to undertake a search, only a female officer is permitted to proceed with such an action.

- If a female officer is not present, the motorist must request the male officer to call a female officer (with an appointment card) to the scene then the action may proceed.

- The absence of a female officer does not mean that you may be let go.

- If you feel your safety is compromised, a female motorist is allowed to remain in the vehicle until a female officer arrives at the scene.

- It is up to you to report a case to the police if you find an officer operating without an appointment card.

- A female motorist is also afforded the right to call for help when her safety is at risk.

""It is up to you as an individual to report the case to the police station. It is easy to verify an officer through an appointment card. If the officer evades that, you can take the van's vehicle registration number,"" acting station commander Nalini Singh previously told News24.

News24","The apparent leader of a group of refugees staying in the Cape Town Methodist Church has been arrested following complaints from other refugees of assault, Western Cape police said on Wednesday.

""The suspect who is from Congo is charged with eight cases of assault - five of which are assault with intention to do grievous bodily harm,"" said Brigadier Novela Potelwa in a statement. The man was not named in the statement.

He is due to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Friday.

After his arrest, about 50 members of the refugee group came to the Cape Town central police station to protest against his arrest.

City of Cape Town to use bylaws to remove refugees

""After being advised to leave, the group duly complied and dispersed. Public Order Police members are keeping an eye on the situation.""

The arrest is part of brewing tensions among refugees who appear to have split into two camps at the Central Methodist Mission.

On Monday, police had to release a stun grenade to stop heated arguments in front of the church on Greenmarket Square, where self-appointed guards were controlling access, News24 reported.

At the time, one of the leaders, Papy Sukami, told News24 that he and JP Balous, with whom he had previously led the group of several hundred people taking refuge, had had a falling out.

""He abused power,"" alleged Sukami. ""People are victims of his behaviour.""

He said Balous was chasing away people who were trying to help them, including Gift of the Givers.

About 600 people, including more than 100 children, have been living in the church since October 30 after they were forcibly removed from a sit-in protest at the nearby Waldorf Arcade.

They had hoped to be relocated to a country other than their countries of origin, saying they were at risk in South Africa.

A small Baptist church in Minneapolis has been reunited with their stolen van, but after seeing the damage to the vehicle, leaders are wondering if it can ever be used again.



In a crowded mechanic’s lot, Youth Minister Renee Lucas is still in disbelief

“There’s a lot of memories in this van,” said Lucas.

Her old van, however, is not the same.

“So obviously they broke the window,” she said, pointing out the damage.

Whoever stole the van, trashed its inside. Even the church’s name and logo was stripped from the van’s exterior.

Then there’s the engine. The cover was cut loose. Cables were cut. The van may no longer drivable, which could be a big loss for the ministry.

“We use it all the time,” she said. “Multiple times in a week.”

Morrison Baptist Church is a small Minneapolis congregation at North 4th Street and 34th Avenue North. For years, the church used the van to deliver food and to bring the congregation to Sunday service. Earlier this month, it disappeared from its parking spot right out front.

“We were hoping somebody was using it to get around for a little bit,” said Lucas. “But, they were pretty destructive to it.”

If it can be fixed, the church is doubtful it can afford the cost. In a season of new beginnings, they have faith in above.

“So, this is an offense to Him to take His van and destroy it this way, but we know that He will provide for us,” said Lucas. “And so, we’re just waiting to see what He does. So, we have hope definitely.”

The van turned up at the impound lot this week after it was abandoned and towed. The church is working with the mechanics at Bona Brothers in Fridley to see if it's even worth fixing.

12,1484191000_1484279734,"Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa has confirmed on-loan Arsenal striker has been recalled by the Premier League club following Wednesday’s 1-1 draw at West Brom.

The England Under-21 international made just his second start in the Sky Bet Championship for the Whites but was replaced at half-time by Patrick Bamford, who grabbed the equaliser for the league leaders.

Nketiah made 19 appearances and scored five goals in total during his temporary switch to Leeds.

Bielsa said: “Arsenal have informed he will not continue with us and we are sorry for that.

“Eddie arrived at Leeds when the Championship had started and had to spend time adapting to our style.

“He didn’t take this decision, but he’s a great player, excellent professional and had very good behaviour – a gentleman in every sense.”

The 20-year-old also took to social media to confirm the news, he wrote on Twitter: “Unfortunately my time Leeds has come to an end.

“It’s been an amazing experience and a privilege to play for such an amazing club. I would like to say a big thank you to my team-mates, the coaching staff and the manager for making my time here an enjoyable one.

“Lastly, a big thank you to all the wonderful fans for taking to me so quickly. I wish the club all the best and I’m sure you’ll get to the promised land.”

Bielsa and Slaven Bilic both accepted that a point apiece was a fair reflection of the match.

The battle of the top two in the Championship began with a bang when Semi Ajayi put the hosts ahead within two minutes.

Leeds fought back in the second half, though, and Bielsa reaped instant rewards after introducing Bamford – he levelled things up after 55 minutes.

Bielsa said: “We should have won the match, but also we could have lost the match. How we managed the game was very good, but there were chances in both boxes.

“Maybe our chances were a little more possible and after we built some situations we couldn’t finish in a chance.

“Nketiah did something to their centre-backs and Bamford took advantage of the exhausted centre-backs due to Nketiah’s work.

“Also Bamford, for his physical characteristics, worked better against their defenders.

“Two sides played the match, no speculation, without violence. We keep within the rules. Nobody wanted to take advantage or use the rules to get an advantage. A team with good intentions, they play differently to us.

“They have great strikers. We managed the match, but we could not avoid them creating chances.”

Bilic, who saw his side miss a golden opportunity to double their lead before half-time when Matty Phillips was denied, could not complain about the result.

“Fair result. Very fair,” Bilic said. “Both teams had chances. We had more chances, but if we count they had more possession, we had more shots, more chances. Very fair. Could have been different if we score the second before half-time.

“All there to score, but praise the goalkeeper. Much harder for them. Enough time, but you become nervous when you have to score two or three to win the game. They had possession, but most of it was where we wanted them to have it.

“Very few times they were splitting us in two. What pleases me is it was not all them after they equalised. (It was a) very open game.

“Both teams should use this to know mentally, ‘Yes, we are good’. We coped with the best. From our side and their side.

“This performance was more than enough to get that momentum back. Told the players I didn’t care about the result yesterday, just wanted them to go out and be themselves.”","Toni Ufoh

West Brom’s player, Semi Ajayi, was the hero and villain in West Brom 1-1 draw in the English Championship game against Leeds United at The Hawthorns stadium on Wednesday.

Ajayi put his side ahead two minutes after the opening of play only to score an own goal in the 52nd minutes of the second half.

West Brom had hoped to bounce back against Leeds after a shocking 2-0 loss to Middlesbrough on Sunday as they surrendered their 14 games unbeaten run.

The former Charlton Athletic and Arsenal academy player had prior before the game charged his teammates to forget the defeat to borough and focus on the match against Leeds in the bid to close the points between his club and Leeds.

He says, “We need to make sure we don’t overreact, the Middlesbrough game was obviously a bad result but at the end of the day it’s only our second loss of the whole season.

“Let’s get back to winning ways and there’s no better time to start than on New Year’s Day.

He has kick-started this by scoring against Leeds even though the error on his part has led to an own goal.

13,1484007605_1484078244,"A former Cambridge University professor has been suspended from the medical register after dishonestly claiming he did not know he was being paid full salaries from two different universities.

Professor Akhilesh Reddy, who is also a medical doctor, was receiving salaries from both University College London (UCL) and the University of Cambridge, but said he believed that he was 'sharing his salary' between the two, a tribunal heard.

The academic, whose dishonesty extended over a period of approximately 14 months, also made a £50,000 mortgage repayment with his large sum of money.

However the tribunal did not accept that Professor Reddy was financially naive and instead said he was a 'financially aware man' who 'dishonestly took advantage of a situation for his own financial gain'.

Professor Akhilesh Reddy (pictured) was receiving salaries from both University College London (UCL) and the University of Cambridge

A medical tribunal heard how Professor Reddy's full-time employment with UCL commenced on September 28, 2015 but the building where he was due to work was not yet completed.

He therefore continued both with his research at the University Of Cambridge and with clinical work at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

However the professor did not resign from the University Of Cambridge where his full-time employment continued until November 30, 2016 and dishonestly claimed two salaries, the tribunal heard.

In a statement read during his tribunal the professor said that 'he did not know he was in receipt of two full-time salaries' and did not check his bank account until February 2016.

The professor also said that he believed that the University Of Cambridge and UCL had 'come to an agreement about balancing payments from the two institutions' and that both establishments were aware of his position.

In a statement read to the tribunal, he said: 'It was my genuine belief that all necessary people were fully aware of the position.

'With the benefit of hindsight, I regret not being more proactive in ensuring that I specifically notified UCL of the situation.

'However, at the time, I thought that my employment situation was clear and widely known.'

However the tribunal did not accept that Professor Reddy was unaware of his situation and felt his argument lacked credibility.

The academic said that he believed the University Of Cambridge and UCL had 'come to an agreement about balancing payments from the two institutions'. Pictured: St John's College, Cambridge University

This was further demonstrated by a £50,000 mortgage repayment.

In a document publishing the decision, the tribunal wrote: 'Whilst the Tribunal accepts that Professor Reddy did not set out to be dishonest, he dishonestly took advantage of a situation for his own financial gain.

'Professor Reddy's dishonesty extended over a period of approximately 14 months and involved a substantial amount of money, albeit an agreed sum of money was repaid.'

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal has suspended Professor Reddy from the medical register for misconduct and the academic has since moved to Pennsylvania in the U.S. to continue his research following the allegations.

A UCL spokesman: 'UCL immediately took action as soon as we became aware that Akhilesh Reddy was drawing two salaries and he is no longer employed by UCL.

'This was a unique set of circumstances that involved the complex transfer of an academic group who remained for a period of time at their previous university before moving to a laboratory separate from UCL's campus.

'The behaviour of the individual involved fell seriously below the standards of behaviour we expect from members of UCL's academic community.'

A University of Cambridge spokesman said it was 'profoundly disappointed' by Professor Reddy's actions.","A kitten was allegedly attacked by hounds running through woodland during an illegal fox hunt on Christmas Eve.

The seven-month-old cat named Tiger, was found 'ripped to pieces' after an illegal hunt carried out by the Badsworth and Bramham Hunt in Scarcroft, West Yorkshire, it has been claimed.

The ginger and white cat, who had been kept at the animal home Cat Action Trust 1977 in Leeds before being adopted with his brother Felix on August 9, was later found dead by his devastated owner.

Following the alleged attack, footage captured by independent hunt monitor and masters student Luke Steele, showed the pack of canines chasing after a lone fox on the morning of the incident.

A kitten named Tiger (pictured) was found 'ripped to pieces' after an illegal fox hunt carried out by the Badsworth and Bramham Hunt in Scarcroft, West Yorkshire, on December 24, it has been claimed

Footage, captured by independent hunt monitor and masters student Luke Steele, later emerged of the pack of canines chasing after a single fox on the morning of the incident

The hounds ran across the grass on the Bramham Estate and they tried to chase the lone fox

During the clip, a lone fox was seen sprinting through grass on the Bramham Estate as it tried to flee from the fierce hounds.

Moments later, the dogs were released and chased after the helpless animal who tried to hide down a badger sett.

Mr Steele said: 'It's absolutely sickening to see a fox being chased to exhaustion by a pack of baying hounds across Bramham Park, an area popular with festival-goers who would be horrified to learn of the cruelty inflicted on hunted wildlife at the venue.

'Bramham Park has important questions to answer about why it hosted the fox hunt in the first place when warned just days before about the Badsworth & Bramham Moor Hunt's record of chasing and killing wildlife.

'The Hunting Act is clear that landowners have a responsibility to ensure wildlife is not chased or killed by hounds on their land and those facilitating hunting could easily find themselves on the wrong side of the law.

The dogs ran through the open area on the morning of the alleged attack on the kitten

Moments later the dogs tried to find the fox who had tried to hide down a badger sett

The hunt was carried out by the Badsworth and Bramham Hunt in Scarcroft, West Yorkshire

'Bramham Park should now fulfil its obligation to prevent wildlife crime and maintain strong community relations by no longer inviting the hunt in light of the events on Christmas Eve.'

Branch leader of Action Trust 1977, Shelia Pickersgill, told Metro.co.uk: 'The owner found the cat.

'The dogs came through and the cat was found all over the place.

'All that's left of him is bits of fur everywhere. 'It's disgusting that this goes on in this day and age. It's barbaric.'

Bramham Estate Resident Agent Nicholas Pritchard said: 'The Badsworth and Bramham Moor Hunt requested permission to meet at Bramham Park on Christmas Eve; they were allowed to onto the estate on the understanding that their activities fell within the law.

'We have been made aware of a serious allegation that the law has been broken and we will cooperate fully with the Police in their investigation.'

Current laws in the UK state that it is illegal to hunt foxes with a pack of dogs however you can use canines to stimulate hunting.

The rules state hunters can use up to two dogs to 'flush' out foxes if the wild animals are damaging their property.

It’s New Year’s Eve, you’re sitting around with friends waiting for the ball to drop, and you’d rather not watch tired musical acts vamping on TV. Jackbox Games releases their party packs for just such an occasion, and Jackbox Party Pack 6 is the latest installment.

All Jackbox games operate the same way: You fire up the game on your console, smart TV or about a million other platforms, and all your guests pull out their phones, tablets, laptops, etc. The games’ prompts are on the TV; the guests’ answers and drawings and selections are on their devices.

It’s a great system, because half the fun of Jackbox games are seeing things that are kept hidden from you until they’re displayed. While Jackbox Party Pack 6 (ranging in price from $21-$30 depending on platform) isn’t the best Jackbox Games offering — it’s missing some notable, wonderful games from previous packages, including Drawful and Fibbage — it’s a solid outing in the series if you already own the previous titles.

If you haven’t ever played Jackbox games, try one of the earlier collections first (numbers one through three are particularly strong.)

Party Pack 6 includes:

Trivia Murder Party 2: One of the best in the bunch, this sequel turns you into woven dolls and asks you trivia questions, pitting you against your friends in a race to escape a haunted hotel in time.

Dictionarium: The favorite among my family this holiday, this game asks you to set meanings for fake words, words for meanings and antonyms, then vote on the frequently-hilarious results.

Push The Button: A twist on the “who’s the murderer” genre, this game makes some of the people in your party aliens, then presents slightly different questions to aliens and non-aliens. The whole group votes on who’s answering just a little oddly, and once people think they know the answer, they can “Push the Button” to put two people in an airlock and jettison them into space. Manipulating this game as an alien is pretty darned fun.

Joke Boat: One of the weaker entries, this game asks you to come up with snappy jokes about supplied topics, which is a core part of all Jackbox games. For some reason, the prompts here don’t work as well as they do in other titles from earlier collections, such as Quiplash.

Role Models: This game has the group pick out who amongst them is best suited for different characters/roles — the characters in Alice in Wonderland, say, or the seasons of the year — and then assigns them personality types as a result.

Our group of five didn’t get into this much, and while my downvote may be affected by my being declared a “domineering angry dreamer” at the end — you can guess who got to be the Red Queen! — we played it just once and moved on.","One dies in Jan 1 auto crash on, Ore Road

16,1517832333_1484217445,"Evergreen Air is a CIA front company for chemtrail operations within the US, based out of Marana Air Park near Tucson Arizona and McMinville Oregon, near Portland.

A major missing piece of a grand conspiracy has been targeted by a drunk pilot. In a small town 30 miles east of the Pacific Ocean in Oregon is the center of a major global operation.

At a bar in McMinnville, Oregon, an inebriated pilot attempted to impress one of the pretty ladies with tales of his secret mission.

The pilot’s pathetic attempt to portray himself as a Sean Connery or Daniel Craig caused him to (ante up) his importance and spill the secrets of the CIA’s asset Evergreen International Aviation.

The slurred revelations confirmed suspicions that Evergreen (International Aviation) is part of the major crap dump on the planet. Chemtrails made up aluminum, barium and other ingredients contribute to respiratory ills and change the acidity of the soil.

Evergreen works from over a 100 bases and employees 4,500 people. Delford Smith privately owns the company. They admittedly “perform” for the CIA.

Evergreen was given a no contest bid that gave them all the facilities in Marana, Arizona that previously belonged to CIA’s Air America (Pinal Air Park, Arizona).

The security at the Pinal site is said to be as severe as that of Area 51. It is run as a military base where one lost pilot got an armed escort immediately off the operational base. The 10 year pilot said it was nothing like anything he has ever seen.

Evergreen International Aviation brags of their planes that have 7 times the capacity of other fire fighters. One can carry 20,000 gallons.

Firefighting … Right … and next we will be told the chemtrails are to prevent global warming as millions more are advancing to an early death.

Evergreen International Aviation has exemptions from the law that are advertised on their web site. They can fly anywhere and not stay on a designated route.

Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei, who founded the Club of Rome in 1968:

“In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.” (Source)

Has CFR members paved the way?

People like Philip Lader and John Wheeler III … they were in a position to do just that.

Evergreen’s public relations (propaganda) spokesman is handled by WPP run by Council on Foreign Relations member Philip Lader. He worked under the present head of the CIA … Leon Panetta as White House deputy of staff under Bill Clinton.

Philip Lader is an “inside” authority on international affairs and business. He is the non-executive Chairman of WPP Group, Senior Adviser to Morgan Stanley International, and a board member for think-tank RAND Corporation.

He is also a trustee of UC Rusal (largest aluminum company in the world) the British Museum and St. Paul’s Cathedral Foundation.

Ambassador Lader has addressed trans-Atlantic audiences from the U.N.’s General Assembly Hall to state chambers of commerce and local world affairs councils, is a member of Rockefeller’s Council on Foreign Relations.

Philip Lader (CFR) is a key player driving toward world government. In addition to running the Public Relations for Evergreen International Aviation … Lader is a director of UC Rusal, the largest Aluminum producer in the world located in Moscow, Sweden, Italy, and Australia. Nathaniel Rothschild is a big investor.

Eugenic operation of Chemtrails has had the assistance of Mitre a non-profit Corporation that manages the Federal Aviation Administration, Homeland Security, and IRS. (1) The IRS is part of the Federal Reserve which is a major transmission belt driving the conspiracy.

Philip Lader’s fellow Council on Foreign Relations member John P Wheeler III was recently dumped into a land fill in Wilmington, Delaware. Wheeler III was a consultant to Mitre the non profit corporation with jurisdictional advice over the Federal Aviation Administration’s flight patterns.

Was John P. Wheeler III to sentimental for the killing underway? And got murdered by the Company?

The CIA is the enforcement arm of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Mitre is conveniently located in McLean,Virginia home of the CIA.

Thanks to the drunken pilot and his loose lips … the Free People of the world can focus on the criminals who are poisoning our air and our water.

Simply getting where you need to go could become an adventure holiday in itself, but not a fun one.

2. WILDLIFE

There are more and more examples of animals falling victim to extreme weather events induced by climate change, such as the horrific mass “cremations” of koalas in the path of recent Australian bush fires or bats dropping dead during heatwaves.

On top of that, news of the latest climate-related animal extinctions are becoming as common as reports of politicians doing nothing about it.

3. HISTORY AND HERITAGE

The Italian city of Venice recently experienced its worst flooding since the mid-1960s, and the local mayor clearly connected this with climate change.

Aside from the human calamity unfolding there, we are seeing one of Europe’s most amazing and unique cities and a World Heritage site devastated before our eyes.

Climate change threatens more than 13,000 archaeological sites in North America alone if sea levels rise by 1m. That goes up to more than 30,000 sites if sea levels rise by 5m.

UNESCO is worried that climate change also threatens underwater heritage sites, such as ruins and shipwrecks. For example, rising salinity and warming waters increases ship-worm populations that consume wooden shipwrecks in the Baltic sea.

4. SNOW SPORTS

Warming temperatures have already had negative impacts on the US snow sports industry since at least 2001.

In Australia, ski resorts are expected to see significant drops in snow fall by 2040 and, as temperatures warm, they will be unable to compensate for this by snow-making, because it doesn’t work if ambient temperatures are too high.

Perhaps recent efforts to make artificial snow will give us a few more years on the slopes, but I’m not holding my breath.

5. SPORTS AND EXERCISE

It’s not just snow sports that will be affected. As temperatures warm, simply being outside in some parts of the world will not only be less pleasant, but more harmful, causing greater risk of heat stress doing any sports or exercise.

That also means lower incentives for – and greater difficult in undertaking – incidental exercise, such as walking to the bus stop.

6. COFFEE

As the climate changes, your coffee hits will probably become rarer and more expensive, too.



A report by the Climate Institute in 2016 suggested coffee production could drop by 50 per cent by 2050.

Given how rapidly negative climate predictions have been updated in the three years since, this might now be considered optimistic. Yikes.

7. HEALTH

As the climate changes, the health of your children, your parents and your grandparents will be at greater risk through increases in air pollution, heatwaves and other factors.

It can be heartening to see the strong, intelligent and positive action being taken by the world’s youth in response to the lack of climate action by many governments.



But the fact that this is a result of a literal existential crisis becoming a normal part of everyday life for young people is utterly horrifying.



8. HOMES

The recent bush fires in Australia and the United States reveal how dramatic and destructive the effects climate change can be to where you live. Hundreds of houses have already burned down in Australia this fire season.

Fires are getting more frequent and more ferocious. The seasonal windows where we safely used controlled burning to clear bushfire fuel are shrinking. It’s not only harder to fight fires when they happen, it’s becoming harder to prevent them as well.

Fires aren’t the only threat to homes. All around the planet, more and more houses are being destroyed by rising seas and increasingly wild storms, all thanks to climate change.



9.WINE

Still not convinced climate change is wrecking things you love? What if I told you it’s even coming for your wine?

Less water, soil degradation and higher temperatures earlier in the season all lead to dramatic negative effects on grapes and wine-making.

One small upside is that disruption to traditional wine growing regions is creating opportunities to develop new wine growing areas. But there is no reason to believe these areas will maintain stable grape growing conditions as climate change progresses.

WHAT NOW?

It’s easy to be sad. But to change our trajectory, it’s better to be mad. In the words of that great English singer songwriter John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), “anger is an energy”.



So maybe use this list as motivation to think, talk and act. Use it as fuel to make small, large or a combination of changes.

Share your concerns, share your solutions, and do this relentlessly.

What’s happening right now is huge, overwhelming, and also inevitable without concerted action. There’s no sugar-coating it: climate change is wrecking the things we love. Time to step it up a notch.

17,1484189339_1484063369,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

From nearly all accounts, former Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera — reportedly the next head coach of the Washington Redskins — is a fine human being and a heck of a football coach.

Josh Norman played for Rivera for four years with the Panthers. The Redskins cornerback was asked Monday what Rivera would bring to the team in terms of culture, and responded, “Everything as you see it today would be different. I’ll say that … because he gets the best out of players.”

Panthers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy told The Athletic the arrival of Rivera at Redskins Park will be “the greatest thing in their careers” for Redskins players.

Rivera, 57 (he will be 58 on Jan. 7), is a pretty good football coach — a two-time NFL Coach of the Year with a 76-63-1 record with Carolina over nine years, including four playoff appearances, three division titles and a 15-1 season in 2015 that led to an NFC championship and a Super Bowl trip, losing to the Denver Broncos 24-10.

“Obviously, he’s a great coach,” Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly said after Rivera was fired last month with a 5-7 record. “He’s given a lot of people a chance in this league. The best part about Coach Rivera is who he is as a person. He genuinely cares about everybody in this locker room — whether you’ve been here for a year, whether you’re an undrafted guy.”

He would also not be the most successful coach that owner Dan Snyder hired to change the losing culture of Washington Redskins since he fired Norv Turner near the end of the 2000 season. He’s fourth on that list.

Marty Schottenheimer had a record of 192-118-1 with 13 playoff appearances in 20 seasons before he was hired in 2001. Joe Gibbs was hired in 2004 and, well, you know his Hall of Fame resume. Mike Shanahan had a record of 138-86 in 14 years with seven playoff appearances and two Super Bowls in Denver before he arrived at Redskins Park in 2010.

Since 2001, the franchise has a record of 124-178-1 — just in case you assume that hiring successful coaches leads to Redskins success.

Look, I’m sorry to be the guy at the party blowing out the candles, but any reasonable person would have to have their memory banks wiped clean to believe that hiring Rivera will then translate to the respect and results that Snyder has futilely searched for during his ownership. Redskins Park is the elephant graveyard of the NFL, where careers go to die.

A deity like Rivera obviously couldn’t survive in the same building with the Prince of Darkness, so team president Bruce Allen got the official boot all the way out the door Monday, exiled to his multi-million dollar West Coast mansion.

Here is part of the statement Snyder issued:

“As this season concludes, Bruce Allen has been relieved of his duties as president of the Washington Redskins and is no longer with the organization.”

No thanks to Allen, Snyder’s wings and beer guy, for being the owner’s lackey for 10 years. It was a far cry from the departure of the last lackey Snyder had in charge, Vinny Cerrato, who was not officially “relieved” but “resigned.”

“We agreed that the franchise needs someone different in this position,” Cerrato said in a statement released by the team.

That, too, was a happy day for Redskins fans — not only celebrating the departure of Cerrato but the arrival of the new savior, someone with a name that was spoken in reverential tones among those fans — the late, great Redskins coach George Allen’s son, Bruce.

Forgive me, but here’s what I wrote when Allen was hired 10 years ago: “The presence of the likable Allen, who seems very much connected to the passion of Redskins fans, might make the franchise better — depending on who his dance partner is (at that point, Mike Shanahan had not been hired yet as head coach).

And then, damn me to hell, I wrote this: “His record as a talent evaluator as general manager of the Raiders and Buccaneers is a mixed bag of success and woeful failures. But now, at least, the dysfunction that permeates Redskin Park might disappear.”

Then at least I had a moment of clarity: “Allen’s arrival and Cerrato’s departure might make fans feel better, but his presence is no guarantee the franchise will rise above the mediocrity in which it has wallowed for 10 years now.”

Now I am drowning in clarity. And you should be as well.

The team announced the move two days after Snyder fired president Bruce Allen. The former Carolina Panthers coach quickly emerged as the Redskins' top candidate and inherits a team that went 3-13 this season and hasn't made the playoffs since 2015.

The 57-year-old of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent is the first minority to be named full-time coach in Redskins franchise history. Rivera is the seventh coach hired by Snyder in his two decades of ownership that have included just five playoff appearances.

Rivera spent the past nine seasons coaching the Panthers, taking them to the Super Bowl in 2015.

“He gets the best out of players,” said Washington cornerback Josh Norman, who played for Rivera with Carolina. “And not just players, but men. He builds men and guys — and also builds character, and sets them up not just for football, but sets (them up) in life. I think that’s the first and foremost thing you want to see in anybody, that they actually care about you instead of the game itself.”

The Redskins the first team that fired its coach this season to fill the position. Snyder zeroed in on Rivera, who flew to Washington on Monday to meet with him about the job.

Rivera replaces interim coach Bill Callahan, a favorite of Allen, who was fired after going 62-97-1 during his 10 years with the organization.

“After several meetings with Coach Rivera, it was clear he is the right person to bring winning football back to Washington, D.C.,"" Snyder said in a statement. “He is widely respected around the league as a man of great integrity and has proven to be one of the finest coaches in the country.”

Snyder and Allen fired Jay Gruden in October after a 0-5 start to his sixth season. Rivera was fired by the Panthers in December after starting 5-7.

Carolina made the playoffs four times during Rivera's tenure, including a 15-1 season in 2015.

“Those Panther teams were tough and physical,” said Washington linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, the team's longest-tenured player. ""Obviously they made the Super Bowl that one year. We played against them that year and they really were a damn good team that year. He’s always had a physical, tough bunch. I know that.”

Rivera previously was a defensive coordinator for the Bears and Chargers. He should boost a Washington defense that underachieved and finished 27th out of 32 NFL teams.

“Just not consistent enough is the big word of the year,"" defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said. ""We have a young group, young defense and, I mean, (the) only place from here is up, honestly.”

Rivera could bring in Steve Wilks as defensive coordinator after time together in Carolina. Wilks spent one season as Arizona's coach and most recently was defensive coordinator in Cleveland under Freddie Kitchens, who was fired Sunday.

Norman, who had his only All-Pro season under Wilks, called him “the best guy for the job.”

Rivera goes from coaching Cam Newton with Carolina to younger quarterback Dwayne Haskins with Washington. Haskins, whom the team selected 15th overall and goes into 2020 as the starter, met Rivera during the pre-draft process.

“He's a good dude,” Haskins said. ""I heard a lot of good things about him. We'll see what happens.”",en,1.15,1.65,1.2,1.9,1.6,1.9,2.6
18,1484013566_1484410180,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - The complexity of the transformation process in South African cricket, amid a desire for a racially diverse team that better represents the country, will again be highlighted on Thursday as selectors pick their side for the second test against England.

South Africa’s previously all-white cricket team has changed dramatically over the last three decades but there remains a quota target in team selection to redress the imbalances from the country’s apartheid era.

At least two black players and another four from South Africa’s mixed-race and Indian communities must play but last week’s first test had two new white players capped while another is expected to debut on Friday in the second test at Newlands.

The quota target fell short by two players in Pretoria after Temba Bavuma suffered a hip injury and was replaced by debutant Rassie van der Dussen, who now looks to retain his place as the No. 5 batsman while Bavuma battles with his fitness.

Dwaine Pretorius was chosen to fill the all-rounder’s berth in the side, ahead of Andile Phehlukwayo, who has played in four tests and 52 One Day Internationals.

Fulfilling the quota requirements while fielding a competitive team has long been a sensitive issue but after a poor 2019, returning to winning ways looks to be the immediate priority of the four selectors, two of whom are black.

Sunday’s first test win arrested a run of five successive defeats but came in tandem with criticism about too many whites in senior roles in and around the team after the recent shake-up of Cricket South Africa.

At the top of the order, coach Mark Boucher has already said Pieter Malan will most likely make his debut on Friday in place of Aiden Markram, who had surgery this week on a broken finger, which could fuel further controversy.

Keegan Petersen, who is of mixed-race, was called to replace Markram in the squad but Boucher said: “For us to go messing around with the opening position wouldn’t be clever.

“Pieter Malan has done a lot of good work over a long period of time. It’s his home ground. At the moment, we are swinging towards having a straight swap for the opening batsman.2

“We understand transformation and we understand we need to do a lot of hard work on a lot of players, especially all-rounders,” Boucher added.",,en,1.0,2.05,1.1,2.8,2.4,1.65,1.75

","Local supplies of type O blood are at critically low levels, and the San Diego Blood Bank is urging those with O positive and O negative blood to donate immediately, the nonprofit said Saturday.

O positive is the most common blood type and therefore in highest demand at hospitals. O negative is the universal blood type and can be given to any patient. It is often used in emergency rooms when there is no time to determine a patient’s blood type, the nonprofit said.

“Coming out of the holiday season, we typically see a decrease in donations of all types at this time due to schools being out of session for the holidays and seasonal illnesses like the flu,” said David Wellis, San Diego Blood Bank CEO. “The need for type O blood has hit a critically low level and we need the community to help us keep a safe supply for local hospital patients.”

Donors can visit one of San Diego Blood Bank’s six centers, as well as bloodmobiles in the community. Appointments can be made at SanDiegoBloodBank.org or by calling (800) 4MY-SDBB. Walk-ins are also welcome. The centers are open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. through New Year’s Eve and will be closed New Year’s Day.

Donors must be at least 17 years old, weigh at least 114 pounds and be in general good health. A government-issued photo ID is required. To prepare, donors are encouraged to get a good night’s sleep, eat a healthy meal an hour beforehand and drink plenty of water.

22,1484036808_1484269316,"Last year, politics in Toronto were marked by tension.

There were threats of provincial cuts, tremendous uncertainty around future transit plans, and big questions about how to pay for the kind of big-picture, city-building projects that Toronto so desperately needs.

With the start of a new year here, many of these issues linger. And as the city enters a brave new decade, council is bracing for more challenges.

Housing plan rolling out

Housing affordability has long been a hot topic in Toronto, and that shows no signs of changing in 2020.

This year marks the start of the city's new decade-long, $23.4-billion housing plan that involves approving 40,000 new affordable rental homes, including 18,000 new supportive units for vulnerable residents. An update on proposals gathered for the Housing Now program, which aims to use 11 city-owned sites for affordable development, is also expected early this year.

But getting shovels in the ground won't happen overnight. While the city is chipping in $8.5 billion, more cash is needed.

""I will be working hard with the other orders of government to ensure the entire plan is fully funded,"" Mayor John Tory has said.

One newly-confirmed housing boost coming is a federal-provincial partnership providing rent subsidies to low-income and marginalized residents including renters in Toronto.

Transit, road safety momentum

On the transit file, construction on the Eglinton Crosstown will be winding down, with the line set to open in 2021. Coun. Josh Matlow says that means it's time to zero-in on streetscape improvements and what the stretch will look like after years of upheaval.

He also hopes council pushes the province for more details on Premier Doug Ford's priority projects, including the Ontario Line, since there are many outstanding questions about the route, feasibility and station locations.

Getting around the city will change in a more concrete way next year as Vision Zero road safety improvements planned by council — including speed limit reductions on streets across the city — become more widespread.

There's also a council-backed bike lane pilot project on Danforth Avenue, between Broadview and Victoria Park avenues, that's expected to start in 2020.

""We need to move it forward,"" said Coun. Brad Bradford, who stressed that the project involves making the stretch safer for all road users.

New visions for neighbourhoods

Transformative neighbourhood proposals could be a key theme for 2020.

Coun. Kristyn Wong-Tam said one iconic downtown roadway in particular — Yonge Street — could be transformed with a safety focus, with recommendations set to come to council next summer.

""We have an opportunity to rethink, re-imagine, and ultimately redesign and reconstruct Yonge Street for the next 100 years,"" Wong-Tam said, ""and that includes opportunities to widen the sidewalk to put pedestrian priority emphasis on this downtown portion.""

There will also be updates on the city's ambitious Rail Deck Park concept early in the new year, and more consultations are expected for Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs proposal which, if approved by council this spring, could transform a nearly five-hectare site on the waterfront into a so-called ""smart city.""

Brace for bigger bills

With so many projects in the works, money will yet again be a central issue this year.

""The question was left, well, how do you pay for it?"" Tory recently told CBC Toronto.

While Tory aims to keep property taxes tied to the rate of inflation, his plan to hike a special city building levy did get the green light from council this year.

That means homeowners will see an extra 1 per cent on their property tax bill in 2020, costing the average household an additional $45 annually. Increases will continue until 2025, all meant to raise billions to pay for transit and housing.

And that's not the only area where residents could be paying more, with rates for garbage collection expected to rise, thanks to rebate phase-outs.","It’s officially 2020, so it’s time for the resolutions to begin. I typically don’t like to make resolutions for the new year because they tend to feel like promises I’ll break to myself around month three or four.

But in light of it being a new year and a new decade, I thought it made sense to set some goals for the health of my skin, hair, and nails. So I’m starting off the 2020’s with these 15 resolutions in a concerted effort to do better when it comes to my beauty habits. And this time I plan to make it through the entire year.

Wash my face twice daily. Celebrities like Ciara and La La Anthony pressed how necessary it is to wash your face in the morning and night. And based on the glow of their skin I would certainly take their advice. Washing at night is intuitive, but not in the morning. So I’ve built a wake up routine to keep me on track. I’m already starting to see a difference.

Trim my hair every quarter. Hair growth guru Whitney Eaddy explained that excessive trimming is actually bad for hair growth. “For my clients, I say once a quarter, for some, every three and a half months. I have a proprietary trim that I developed because cosmetologists are taught to cut for shape, but not actually retention,” she told ESSENCE. So I’m taking my cues from her and her growing hands, and only trimming four times a year, and keeping that appointment.

Learn to apply false lashes. I’m very transparent about the fact that I am awful at putting on falsies. I can apply magnetics but not lashes that require glue. That limits the different styles I can wear. Right now I have several pairs of false lashes from brands such as KISS, Sephora, Absolute New York, and more. I’m not willing to consistently pay for lash extensions so this is the year I master this.

Use hair masks. With my low porosity hair it’s always a process finding the right products. And even when I like a product I typically have to deep condition with a heat cap every time I wash with it. For that reason I’ve stayed away from extra steps, like masks. But masks can be great for hydrating thirsty strands, and even for deep conditioning. This year I’ll make sure I find the right masks, and start to reap their benefits for the sake of my strands.

Drink more water. Every year I say I’ll drink more water and every year I fail. It’s mainly because I don’t drink a lot of liquids overall. But your skin will always benefit from an abundance of clean water. It goes hand in hand with washing your face twice a day.

Drink less wine. This goes hand in hand with drinking more water. I love wine, but alcohol undoubtedly ages your skin. If I can replace some of my wine with water I’ll be on my way to truly making 40 look like the new 20.

Experiment with hair color. It’s been years since I’ve colored my hair in an attempt to get it back to its virgin state. But when I see celebs like Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B sporting brightly colored tresses I get a little nostalgic. I don’t necessarily need to dye my curls, but this year I want to explore more colored units, hair gels, and temporary color sprays.

Invest in eco-friendly brands (specifically ones who cut down on plastic use). We had significant conversations about climate change in 2019 and it shook me. I realized that I needed to do more in my daily life to combat environmental issues. Most plastics are non-recyclable and they dominate when it comes to our beauty product containers. It’ll take more work on my part to find the brands and products that use alternatives, but well worth it.

Do more natural DIY skincare. One of my face washes contained something called sodium lauroamphoacetate. When I looked it up I still didn’t understand what it was made of and why I needed it in my facial cleanser. That was one of 10 chemicals that I couldn’t pronounce in this one product. It made me yearn for the days of avocado and banana masks to keep my breakouts at bay. So in 2020 there will be more of that, and less PEG 120 methyl glucose dioleate.

Don’t sweat the small stuff. Stress leads to breakouts, and breakouts stress you out. This year I’m committing to spending less time worrying about the little daily stressors. This is a lofty goal for someone who lives in a city of more than 8 million people. More people, more problems. But I’m also not going to obsess about the occasional pimple on the cheek, gray hair sprouting at the hairline, or quickly disintegrating manicure.

Treat my edges like a newborn baby. I’m going to feed them only the best stuff. I’m going to care for them like they’re delicate. I will massage them gently, and make sure I’m doing the most to care for them daily. This year my edges will grow for me!

Be consistent with supplements. I’ve seen firsthand the benefits of supplements when I use them as directed, and consistently. It can feel like an extra thing to do in the morning but once you work it into your schedule it becomes second nature. I want enviable skin, hair, and nails for the next decade.

Ask more questions. I’m a journalist so I’m always asking lots of questions, all the time. But when I’m talking to brands about their ingredients claims I could stand to ask their reps more questions, not just my dermatologist. It’s never enough to just know what’s in your products, but it’s imperative to know exactly what they do, and if they’re worth what you’re paying.

Eat less carbs. I love my pizza, pasta, breads, and chips, but all that stuff turns to sugar and sugar gives me pimples and rough skin. While health and beauty go hand in hand in many ways this is completely for skincare purposes. What you eat can show up on your face. A sugary face might sound like a sweet dream, but it’s really an exfoliating nightmare.

Use less products overall. It’s so important to find what works for you and stick to those products. While I’m never going to stop trying products (I’m a beauty editor and a product lover), I’ll be better about not switching my main items so often. This will keep the clogged pores away for face and hair.

23,1484188395_1483958770,"Harpoon's Baltic Porter aged in WhistlePig barrels Harpoon Brewery

Founded along the Boston waterfront in 1986, Harpoon Brewery is among the country’s first craft breweries. It has been heralded as a New England staple practically since inception. Vermont-based WhistlePig launched in 2008 as one of the first purveyors of premium rye. Today it, too, is widely viewed as a classic liquid of the Northeast. So it’s only fitting that these two brands would eventually collaborate. That auspicious moment arrived earlier this month when Harpoon announced the release of its Baltic Porter, aged in select WhistlePig barrels.

The 9.5% ABV beer contains hints of molasses and stone fruit, finishing with notes of bittersweet cacao. Dark yet still slightly light in body it has a warming effect from the boozy barrel aging that is well-suited to wintertime sipping. The original liquid was brewed in previous years—minus the added aging. But the brewery decided a partnership with the rye would suss out even more magic from the initial fermentation.

“When we decided to bring back our Baltic Porter, we wanted to introduce a special edge to make it our best one yet,” says Dan Kenary, CEO and co-founder of Harpoon Brewery. “We thought, what better way to foster innovation than to partner with our neighbors at WhistlePig, bringing our brewers and their talented distillers together for a meaningful and delicious collaboration.” Harpoon operates a taproom and beer garden in central Vermont, not far from WhistlePig’s farmhouse distillery.

“We were excited about the opportunity to bring wintery warmth to this popular brew in a way that only our unique rye whiskey barrels can,” says Pete Lynch, Master Blender for WhistlePig. “And Harpoon Brewery is well-known across all of New England.” So when the brewery approached him, he didn’t hesitate to pursue the partnership.

Barrel-aged beers are certainly nothing new. In fact, every year Chicago celebrates the broad category with its own Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beer. The 17th Annual iteration this past November lined up with the release of Goose Island’s illustrious Bourbon County Stout—commonly cited as the pioneer of whiskey cask finished beer.

Typically brews such as these are stored in barrels sourced from third party brokers. Rarer are the releases where a brewery collaborates in direct partnership with the booze maker. Chicago-based Forbidden Root introduced an intriguing example of such in 2017, with its imperial black ale brewed with the herbs and spices familiar to Fernet-Branca. This bold cult classic never spent time in oak, however. The practice is gaining mainstream traction now, after Jim Beam hooked up with Budweiser on two recent releases: a copper lager aged in casks of the whiskey brand’s white label, and a black lager aged in Jim Beam Black barrels.

As for Harpoon and WhistlePig, the partnership appears to be a one-off—for now. Their Baltic Porter was released in 12-packs of 22 oz. bottles and is now available on draft at Harpoon Brewery’s Boston and Vermont locations. But if thirsty New Englanders have anything to say about it, you can expect this to be merely the start of a beautiful friendship.","A custom modular house in Amagansett is listed for $3.299 million. This brand-new home was built in 2017 and is now looking for its first owner.

“It’s a great house for a family that entertains,” says Michael Cinque, the listing agent, and the builder, adding “it’s pretty much on one level. From the kitchen, you can see the front door, the living room, the back deck and then the pool, so even the chef or the mom can be at the party.”

The 3,000-square-foot house has four bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms, and two garages. It’s located on the Montauk Highway, and within walking distance to the beach and restaurants in town.

Annual taxes are $13,425. It is in the Amagansett Union Free School District.

24,1484013670_1484139668,"I spent some time away from social media over the holidays, and came back with a couple of observations. Or maybe just one. First of all, everybody should do that — perhaps permanently — because social media in general is kind of nuts. But political Twitter, in particular, is insane. Second of all, and I know this comes under the heading of “no sh*t, Sherlock,” Democrats on Twitter are tormenting themselves (and each other) by endlessly rehashing the 2016 election. They have simply got to get over it.

If you already spend too much time perusing other people’s political opinions on Twitter, you know what I’m talking about. If you don’t, you are definitely better off. I see no point in calling out specific individuals who should know better (cough cough, Neera Tanden and Joy Reid) or the most outrageous accusations of treason and war crimes and secret allegiance to Trump or Putin or the Bilderberg Society or whatever. But the amount of grudge and grievance and name-calling and recrimination and hive-mind clapback and paranoid mythology, nearly all of it rooted in the leftover bad feelings of the Hillary v. Bernie conflict of 2016, is astonishing. It’s damaging and dangerous and downright Trumpy, and yet more evidence that the virus that produced him has infected us all.

I don’t want to be all “both sides do it.” But in fact both sides do do it, while accusing the other of being the worst people in human history. And I’m not trying to pull some Jon Stewart “Rally for Normies” bullshit about the evils of polarization and division, because I know where that boat ride takes: Across the River Styx into the land where Joe Biden muses about picking a Republican running mate.

I’m definitely not suggesting there were no important differences between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in that campaign, or between Sanders and Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren and What’s His Name, the mayor of River City, in this one. There were and there are. I’m not lecturing anyone to Vote Blue No Matter Who, because it absolutely matters who wins the nomination, and that will clearly affect how many people Vote Blue. (You and I may well view that equation in different ways — isn’t that the point of a primary campaign?)

Apparently we will never stop hearing that Hillary Clinton is a soulless killer, the greatest war criminal since Attila the Hun, a toady to Big Capital and foe of economic justice, a mastermind of phony performative feminism and (simultaneously) the owner-operator of the most clueless and incompetent presidential campaign in media-age history. Or, on the other side of the ledger, that Bernie Sanders is a crypto-racist and crypto-sexist, a tool of the Russians and a fellow traveler of Donald Trump, a Stalinist, a Trotskyist, an agent of destruction and (simultaneously) the commander of an all-white online dude-bro army and the possessor of hypnotic powers over young women and latte-guzzling hipsters of color.

Advertisement:

I’m here to offer both sides the terms of a truce that no one will like. (Which is kind of how it works with truces.) The first step is to recognize that all of this is the haunted legacy of an election cycle that, in case you need a little refresher, didn’t go so well. Sanders lost a close race to Clinton (that wasn’t supposed to be close), and then Clinton lost an even closer race to Donald Trump (ditto) — and ever since then, each side has never, even for a second, stopped blaming the other for what went wrong. Democrats have been gnawing on the bones of the 2016 election for three years now, and while they came out of their cave for the 2018 midterms, it honestly didn’t help that much.

Now the most online, most committed cadre of Democrats seem to be trying — only half-consciously, but with considerable dedication — to cast the 2020 election as a fanfic reboot of the 2016 election, with all of its least appealing ingredients on endless loop. It’s like a damaged child re-enacting an especially traumatic family drama, in search of — well, what exactly? Revenge or redemption or some form of sympathetic magic in which we roll back the clock and none of the bad stuff happened and we are all OK again? (Depending of course on your conception of who “we” are and what “OK” might look like.) Or just in search of another defeat that can be blamed on someone else? I have reflected on this and, to coin a phrase, I hate it.

On one level, I get it: The 2016 election was a galvanizing experience with a dreadful outcome. It exposed a generational and ideological third rail within the Democratic coalition that also touched race and gender and class and which, by its very nature, is not likely to heal anytime soon. Political parties have a known tendency to re-enact internal grudge matches over and over, and to ignore their own best advice. Consider the Republican Party, which announced after Mitt Romney’s defeat in 2012 that it would seek to build a broader coalition and reach out to Latinos, Asians, women and younger voters — and then proceeded to win the next election by going in precisely the opposite direction as hard as it possibly could.

Democrats came out of the grisly spectacle of 2016 with what seemed like an obvious vacancy: They needed to find a candidate and a message that could at least temporarily bridge the gulf between “progressives” and “moderates,” between class-based politics and representational politics, between the BernieBros and Pantsuit Nation. (If you feel the need to notify me that those are inaccurate and reductive stereotypes, please don’t. I am aware!)

That didn’t happen, as Kirsten Gillibrand, Beto O’Rourke and Kamala Harris could tell you. Instead we have been subjected to endless, pointless, airless debates about who is more “electable,” which all boil down to the Bernie-Hillary split in barely concealed form, and which all run aground on the great reef known as Nobody-Has-a-Solitary-Clue Land.

Advertisement:

Now we find ourselves partway through an uncomfortable remake in which Bernie Sanders is playing himself (a bit older and with a slightly different voter base) and in which Hillary Clinton has, so far and by the skin of her teeth, avoided doing the same thing. You know she wanted to! She could pretty much taste it! I encountered a thread from wounded Hillary-stans urging her to run this week, well past the ballot deadlines for nearly all the early states right through Super Tuesday. It must have been a bitter disappointment for her to hear that between Biden, Warren and Pete Buttigieg, her issues, advisers, consultants and major donors were pretty much all spoken for. (Even so, after Harris dropped out I still thought Clinton might give it a whirl.)

As stated, I have a plan for a truce between the factions, because without one the Democrats are in danger of dying in their own bonfire once again. Like any true military truce, it does not require any final agreement on who is virtuous and who is evil. I had a whole list of terms drawn up, and then I realized they all flowed from one central principle, which is then divisible into two clear propositions. Accept these terms, Democrats, and you will be free. (For the record: Ha, no — I’m not kidding myself.)

The big thing: You lost! Deal with it

Advertisement:

Yeah, so that’s the central principle: You lost, Democrats! You fucking lost. Practice saying that in the mirror. Your candidate didn’t win the election, did s/he? And the thing that happens when you don’t win? That’s called losing. It doesn’t matter whether you are a Real Democrat who is Still With Her or a devoted Political Revolutionary ready to Burn It All Down. You lost. It's time to put on the big-girl pants. Quit creating imaginary universes where it didn’t happen, and quit whining about how you actually won except that other people were mean and weird and totally cheated. You lost. Sanders lost to Clinton and Clinton lost to Trump. There were no consolation prizes or moral victories, only the taste of blood and ashes and broken teeth. It completely sucked. That’s reality.

From that reality emerge the two planks of our truce. I already warned you that you weren’t going to like them.

The 2016 Democratic campaign wasn’t rigged. Hillary Clinton won. Nobody says you have to like it.

Look, I wasn't a fan of the Democrats' 2016 nomination process either (and the revised version sucks too). But everybody understood the rules in advance, hinky as they were, and Hillary Clinton won more states and got more votes. The end. Yes, it was a much closer race than anyone expected, including Bernie Sanders, and I understand the yearning to believe that it coulda or shoulda been different. (If Sanders had won both Iowa and New Hampshire, or had won one more big state — maybe New York or California — or had kept the margins close in the South, it really might have been.) But Clinton won the nomination, approximately fair and square.

Advertisement:

Sure, there’s a hypothetical argument that the existence of all those Clinton-committed superdelegates distorted the race from the outset and made her appear to have an insurmountable lead. There’s a more conspiratorial argument that the Democratic National Committee’s unmistakable Clinton lean depressed the Sanders vote and gave her an intangible advantage. Believe whatever you want about what might have happened under different circumstances, but to put it not-very-delicately, those are the kinds of excuses losers make.

There is no way to redeem or renew the Democratic Party without acknowledging that — at least as it was four years ago, and quite likely as it is now — Democratic voters are a lot more cautious than the party's activist base. Which, come to think of it, makes a perfect segue to Plank No. 2:

Bernie didn’t give us Trump! Hate on him all you want, but Sanders and his supporters didn’t cause this.

Yeah, I’m aware of the arithmetic being waved around that purports to show that around 10 to 12 percent of Sanders’ primary voters actually voted for Trump in the general election, and that fully one in four Sanders voters didn’t turn out for Hillary Clinton. If those defectors had plugged their noses and yanked the lever for Team D, that would almost certainly have been enough to tip the scales in those three Trump states we’re all so sick of hearing about, right?

Sure. But that’s a deeply illogical, cherry-picking argument, whose only merit is that in an election that close and that flukish, you can point to any factor you want and claim it was definitive. There’s nothing special or unique about the Bernie-to-Trump voters — if you want to look at it this way, they were more than canceled out by the 10 percent of Marco Rubio supporters and the 32 percent of John Kasich supporters who wound up voting for Clinton. Perhaps more to the point, there is zero evidence that those people were ever going to vote for Hillary Clinton under any circumstances. The likeliest explanation for their voting behavior is that they hated her guts.

Advertisement:

Those eager to blame the self-indulgent socialist BernieBros for electing Trump are deliberately ignoring data from the 2008 general election, when most sources agree that a larger proportion of Hillary Clinton's primary supporters refused to vote for Barack Obama after their acrimonious primary combat. As many as 25 percent of Clinton's supporters ended up voting for John McCain, but since Obama won easily, no one particularly noticed or cared.

Party-switching of that type isn't uncommon, and after any contested primary election there will be defectors who simply can’t stand the nominee. It’s certainly legitimate to lament the existence of Bernie-to-Trump voters. But it’s not reasonable to claim that they were loyal Democrats who were turned into evil anarchist robots by some uniquely toxic quality of the Sanders campaign.

Here's an even more important statistic: Between 3 million and 3.5 million registered Democrats or “Democrat-leaners” voted for Donald Trump in 2016. That’s more than twice as much as the most generous estimate of Bernie-to-Trump voters, yet for some reason you don’t encounter self-righteous online ire directed at those folks, who presumably were not a bunch of disgruntled leftists all het up about the oligarchy and Goldman Sachs.

Why is that, exactly? Because for the Democratic Party as currently constituted, voters who drift toward the Republicans out of racism or “economic anxiety” or culture-war issues are seen as tragic but unavoidable features of the landscape. They are mythologized and yearned after and obsessed over. Endless amounts of energy is expended on strategies meant to win them back. They are held up as compelling evidence that Democrats must “moderate” their policies in order to win elections. I probably don’t need to tell anybody reading this that the track record for that strategy isn’t all that great.

Advertisement:

Maybe you still believe that middle-ground blandness is the only way to save democracy from the Trump threat, and Joe Biden is right that enough of the “deplorables” have repented of their 2016 vote and will come skulking back to the Democratic Party as long as its not overly radical or woke and has no goals beyond calming things down a bit. OK then! That still doesn’t explain the fact that left-wing voters who reject the Democratic Party — which a pretty small group, let’s be honest — are invariably seen as irresponsible puritans or malicious saboteurs, and are singled out for blame and shame anytime Democrats lose.

Again, why is that? Every vote that your candidate or your party doesn’t get is equally damaging, no? Why are some treated differently from others?

Here's why: Because mainstream Democrats define themselves almost entirely in negative terms, as the opposition to the increasingly scary Republicans and the far right, and see themselves as engaged in a reasonable, responsible contest for the middle ground of American politics. Rightward pressure, even if regrettable, nurtures Democrats’ self-image. It reassures them that they stand on one pole in a Manichaean conflict between good and evil. In such a conflict, to win back voters from the Republicans at virtually any price, in order to gain or hold power, is a noble cause.

Leftward pressure, on the other hand, is disorienting and destabilizing, and throws that moral equation into doubt. If there are more than two poles on the political compass, and if the Democratic Party has actual enemies to its left who would like to defeat it or conquer it or at least compel it to accommodate them for once, then the basic principles of America’s political duopoly and the party’s raison d’être — which foregrounds compromise, triangulation and an ideology of no-ideology — are under threat.

Right-wing rebellion is always understood (by Democrats) as legitimate and serious, an Issue that must be addressed. Left-wing rebellion is always seen as illegitimate, perverse and contemptible, and must be crushed. Rescuing the Democratic Party from its current aimless drift — in the election year just ahead or in this new decade or just sometime in this century — is not a matter of embracing one side of that divide and rejecting the other. It's about facing an altered political landscape with honesty and clarity, and leaving behind the realm of denial, delusion and fantasy that have rendered our politics so empty and so stupid for so long.","Andrew Yang began his closing statement at the last Democratic debate with a charming bit of self-deprecation: “I know what you’re thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them?”

Yang has never been elected to any office. He is a businessman who has never run a major company. Even so, he is one of the Democratic Party’s seven leading candidates for an election that everybody agrees is desperately important. The other six on the debate stage included another businessman who has never held office and a mayor who has never won an election with more than 10,991 votes.

As funny as Yang’s line may have been, he was highlighting a real problem: Our process for selecting presidential nominees is badly flawed.

It is, as Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja recently wrote in The Atlantic, “a spectacle that would have struck earlier generations as ludicrous.” It has come to resemble a reality television show, in which a pseudo-scientific process (polls plus donor numbers) winnows the field. The winner is then chosen by a distorted series of primaries and caucuses: The same few states always get outsize influence, and a crude, unranked voting system can produce a nominee whom most people don’t want.

No wonder the current president is a reality-television star, not to mention the most unfit occupant of the office in our country’s history. “The victory of Donald Trump in 2016 is best understood as a failure of the process,” political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has written, “and a failure of the Republican Party to prevent an outsider from taking its presidential nomination — the most important thing that U.S. political parties have.”

The current system may seem as if it’s simply an expression of democracy, but it’s not. It’s one version of democracy. And it’s one that virtually no other country uses. In other democracies, political parties have more sway in selecting the nominee, and voters then choose among the major nominees. Until recently, the United States also gave party leaders a larger role in selecting nominees.

Today’s leaders have abdicated this job, afraid to do anything that might appear elitist because it substitutes the judgment of experts for that of ordinary citizens. The irony is that the new process may actually do a poorer job of picking nominees whom ordinary citizens like, as research by Dennis Spies and André Kaiser, looking across countries, suggests.

How could this be? When voters are given the dominant role in choosing a nominee — as with primaries here — only an unrepresentative subset tends to participate, which skews the process. Party leaders, on the other hand, have a big incentive to choose a broadly liked candidate. Just think about American history: Nominees chosen by party leaders have included Abraham Lincoln, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower.

I’m not suggesting we return to the smoke-filled rooms of the past. But the current process puts a higher priority on the appearance of democracy than the reality of it. We’re left with candidates fighting to do well enough in early polls to get into the debates and then to win 30% of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, which can launch them toward the nomination.

A better approach would balance snapshots of popular opinion with rules more likely to produce strong, qualified nominees.

The first change should be to the debates. The candidates’ electoral history and qualifications currently count for nothing. The 2020 Democratic field, for example, has included four two-term governors, all of whom have been excluded from debates despite a track record of winning votes and governing successfully. In their place have been candidates, like Yang, who managed to crack 4% in a few polls.

It makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots. Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.

A second set of changes would involve the primaries themselves. More states should adopt ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to list their second and third choices. Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco and the state of Maine, among other places, have adopted this system for some elections.

Ranked choice can prevent the Trump phenomenon during the 2016 Republican primaries. Trump may have solid Republican support today, but he didn’t back then. Even though most Republican voters opposed him, his dedicated base let him emerge from a large field.

It’s also past time to end the special treatment that Iowa and New Hampshire receive, by always voting first. They are two overwhelmingly white, disproportionately baby boomer states (and the fact that Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008 doesn’t give it a permanent pass). The primary calendar should instead rotate every four years, with the first states always including a mix of states: big and small, young and old, urban and rural, coastal and heartland.

The seven candidates who made the last Democratic debate stage all have their strengths, but as a group, they offer an indictment of the nomination process. There are three candidates in their 70s — and no African American or Latino. There are two people who have never won an election — and zero who have ever run a state.

Of course, the biggest sign that the process is broken isn’t any of those seven. It is the man in the Oval Office.",en,1.333333333,2.476190476,1.380952381,2.952380952,2.714285714,2.142857143,1.857142857

We've all heard about it being unlucky to leave your decorations up after the Twelfth Night, but what about laundry?

Well it seems there are a number of superstitions around doing your laundry on New Year's Day and none of them are good.

In fact, if the such superstitions are to be believed, doing laundry on January 1 will wash away any good luck for the following year.

Some believe a member of the family could be washed away - or die - during the year too, according to the Manchester Evening News.

It's not known where the bizarre superstition originates, but many people do seem to observe it.

Some have even been known to even avoid washing the dishes for fear of the superstition coming true.

Manchester mum Rebecca James hadn't heard about it until seeing a recent Facebook post about it - but will obviously be following the advice.

Rebecca, who has two children and two stepchildren, said: ""I'd never heard of it but it was on a discussion on a Mrs Hinch page on Facebook.

""I'm 100% following it and there will definitely no washing in my house.""

The new year superstitions don't just stop with laundry.

Others include not removing anything from your home on New Year's Day, not even the rubbish - the belief being that any prosperity that is in the house stays inside.

While many superstitions centre around food - pork is considered good luck as pigs forage for their food, but lobster or crabs are bad luck apparently as they move sideways.","ROCK HILL, S.C. — Police in Rock Hill are investigating a shooting that sent three people to the hospital shortly after midnight on New Year's Day.

3 through tracing of the contacts of positive cases (381 tests)

2 from hospital labs (162 tests)

A total of 6499 tests have been carried out from 20,000 wider testing programme of the government.

“The figures of the past days create a picture which satisfies us,” Dr Leontios Kostrikis told the daily press conference.

“We now have before us clear results and not just indicatations. It is the reward of the collective effort. We are on a very good road and must continue on the same track with the same dtermination,” he said.

Dr Marios Loizou said that at 3 pm on Friday there were 19 coronavirus hospital at the referral hospital, three of them in the special care unit.

Nine are intubated in the ICU of Nicosia and Limassol Hospital while four are in the ICU but not intubated.

Another eight are in wards in hospitals.

Loizou said that life must slowly slowly resume. To strike the fine balance between relaxing the measures and the need perhaps to restore the measures if there is an increase in cases, the decisive element will be adequacy of the health system to cope with a new increased flow of patients.

“As long as the health system can cope, then life can come closer to its natural pace. It will be a lengthy effort until the virus can be defeated, either with a vaccine or with a large percentage of the population acquiring immunity,” he said.

""This could quickly blossom,"" Gen. Joseph Lengyel told Pentagon reporters Thursday.

At the moment, just over 2,000 members of the National Guard are assisting governors in 27 states, doing things such as helping with testing and transportation. Lengyel said that number could double by this weekend.

There are some 450,000 Guardsmen in the Air Guard and National Guard.

Lengyel said he doesn't see the need to federalize the guard, meaning it would come under control of the president. He said it's more efficient to leave it under state control.

On Thursday, President Trump appeared to agree. At a meeting with a group of governors, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia told Trump to ""leave the directives for the National Guard with the governors.""

""That's done. I like it,"" Trump responded.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

We're going to talk now about what the U.S. military can or should do to help the country fight the coronavirus. Defense Secretary Mark Esper says the department is providing millions of protective masks and 2,000 respirators. Military hospital ships are getting ready to sail, and field hospitals are on standby. We've got NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman with us this morning.

Hi, Tom.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel.

MARTIN: So a lot of what's being done now is through the National Guard - right? - since they essentially work for the governors, and they're already living in these communities.

BOWMAN: Yeah, that's right. The head of the National Guard, General Joseph Lengyel, said there are now more than 2,000 guard members helping in 27 states. And, Rachel, he said that 2,000 number will double by the weekend. And he expected tens of thousands of guardsmen to be deployed in the coming weeks and months.

Now, General Lengyel also said he doesn't see the need to federalize the guard - meaning it would come under control of the president. He says the governors have a better sense of how the Guard should be used. So at this point, it's up to each individual state. And one key thing to remember is the federal government - if they assume control of the guard, it would be forbidden to engage in domestic law enforcement.

MARTIN: What is the guard doing right now? And what could they be doing?

BOWMAN: Well, they're doing everything from providing transportation to assisting in testing to medical assistance to helping with planning for the governors. Now, they could also help with police and law enforcement as well. And members of the Tennessee Guard helped in a different way. They recently flew a half-million swabs for coronavirus testing from Italy to Memphis, Tenn., and then they'll be distributed by FedEx. And these swabs will be used in testing, and then the swabs will be sent to labs.

So you could see guard members helping out in that effort - maybe moving these tests from where they were initiated to the labs. Now, we were told yesterday by senior Pentagon health officers that the 15 Pentagon labs could assist in analyzing those swabs. They said that they could do tens of thousands each day - so a significant number.

MARTIN: Tom, what about these huge hospital ships that the military has? We've heard reports that they are going to be deployed in hot zones. They take a long time to move, though, don't they?

BOWMAN: You know, they do. The hospital ship Mercy on the West Coast is expected to get underway as early as Monday. No official word yet where it's going. One official told me Seattle, but California wants the hospital ship, too. And the hospital ship Comfort on the East Coast - it will take weeks to get going because of maintenance and other issues. That ship will head to New York. And each ship, Rachel, has 1,000 beds. And - but they'll not be dealing with coronavirus but taking the pressure off local hospitals by, you know, handling other medical needs.

MARTIN: Right. And, Tom, you're working out of the Pentagon. There are still thousands of people working there, right? I mean...

The U.S. military said it is working to convert buildings into hospitals and could potentially provide 10,000 hospital beds in New York, as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the head of the US Army Corps of Engineers, said Friday that retrofitting hotels or dormitories into temporary hospitals to alleviate the burden on civilian hospitals caused by the virus could be done relatively quickly.""We would like to think we can do this in three or four weeks and try to go as fast as we can,"" Semonite told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday.He said the Army Corps of Engineers had developed a standard design and contract in order to help facilitate the process.""This is an unbelievably complicated problem, and there is no way we're going to be able to do this with a complicated option -- we need something super simple,"" he said, adding that they were aiming to turn empty hotels, college dormitories and other buildings into hospitals capable of providing intensive care, adding that the state would be responsible for identifying the buildings and staffing them.Related video above: National Guard prepared to respond to states' needsNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had asked for the Corps to retrofit buildings into hospitals to help alleviate the burden on hospitals treating a major influx of coronavirus patients.Asked about New York, Semonite said, ""We're talking about over 10,000 (hospital beds) that we are looking at right now, FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) has to make a decision and we will exercise whatever FEMA tasks us to do.""Semonite confirmed that the Corps had looked at buildings including the Javits Center, which is a major convention center in Manhattan.""We did the Javits Center yesterday, and we were in to some of the SUNY schools yesterday,"" Semonite said.As of late Friday morning, there were more than 7,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in New York state, with 35 deaths.Multiple states seeking supportSemonite acknowledged that multiple states were seeking similar support.""We can't do everywhere so we are really asking for the federal government to be able to help prioritize our efforts, with (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) to be able to send us to the right place.

We have to give them the go-ahead; if we find that it's going to be necessary, we think that we can have quite a few units up very rapidly,"" Trump said at a White House news conference.On Sunday, Cuomo penned an op-ed in The New York Times asking for the military to have the Army Corps of Engineers build hospitals to alleviate the burden on civilian hospitals.""This is exactly what they do.

28,1484038997_1584239254,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Monday evening a series of measures that aim to restrict social contact in the United Kingdom, so as to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Johnson made the announcement during a TV address to the nation. “From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction: you must stay at home,” said the prime minister.

Starting from tonight, people in Britain will only be allowed to leave their homes for “very limited purposes,” including shopping for basic necessities, for any medical need, for one form of exercise a day, and to travel to and from work when necessary, said Johnson.

Meanwhile, all shops selling non-essential goods, such as clothing and electronic stores, are ordered to close, and places like libraries, playgrounds, and outdoor gyms will also be closed.

All social events and even gatherings of more than two people in public, excluding people one lives with, are banned.

Police have powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, according to Johnson.

The tougher new measures will be in place for at least three weeks from this evening, according to the government.

The announcement came after the prime minister warned Sunday that the government will have to go further if people do not follow its advice.

The government has been stepping up its measures in recent weeks. It was only on March 20 that the government announced that Cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants, etc. must close.

But during the weekend, large groups of people can still be seen in some parks and tourist hot spots, prompting concerns that many people might be ignoring the government’s advice of avoiding social contact.

This is in addition to the fact that the growth of UK’s COVID-19 cases is still substantial.

As of Monday morning, there had been 6,650 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK, an increase of 967 in the past 24 hours, according to the latest figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care. A total of 335 COVID-19 patients had died, the figures showed.

“Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,” said Johnson.","PanARMENIAN.Net - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown in the country, with a ban on gatherings of more than two people and strict limits on exercise, The Guradian reports.

In the UK, the number of those who have died from the disease the virus causes, COVID-19, increased by 54, bringing the toll in the country to 335 among 6,650 cases.

The Prime Minister ratcheted up Britain's response with an address to the nation on Monday, March 23 evening, warning that people would only be allowed outside to buy food or medication, exercise alone once a day, or to travel to work if absolutely necessary.

All non-essential shops will close with immediate effect, as will playgrounds and libraries, he said in the address from Downing Street.

After days of being accused of sending mixed messages about what the public should do, Johnson significantly escalated his language as he urged people to comply with the more stringent measures.

""You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can,"" he said.

""If you don't follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.""

New York City Reports 2 Additional Suspected Cases of Coronavirus

New York City health officials have said they are testing two new people as suspected cases of coronavirus on Feb. 5, bringing to the total number of suspected cases in the city to four.

The two new patients, both under 40 years old, had recently traveled to China and were suffering from a “fever and cough or shortness of breath without another common cause, like influenza and other cold viruses,” the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said in a statement.

One patient has been hospitalized while the other is self-isolating at home as the person “did not have symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization.”

The statement did not elaborate where in China the two new patients had traveled to.

“New York City is on high alert and prepared to handle any confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio, according to the statement.

The mayor added: “My message to New Yorkers remains the same: if you have the travel history and are exhibiting symptoms, please see your health provider immediately.”

Before the announcement, the city had already reported three suspected cases of the virus. However, one person was cleared of the virus on Wednesday after their test came back negative.

The city’s Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said it was “fortunate” that the first person tested negative, according to the statement.

“But we expect to see more people presenting to health care facilities with symptoms of the novel coronavirus.”

Currently, there are 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States: six of them in California, two in Illinois, one in Arizona, one in Massachusetts, one in the state of Washington, and one in Wisconsin.

Acknowledging this, several organisations offer free counselling to help people grapple with their fears.

The Department of Psychology, Rathinam Group of Institutes

Covid Mind Support is an initiative launched to provide mental and emotional support. “It is a difficult time for everyone and taking care of mental health is very important. When I suggested the idea of providing free counselling, I got a good response from my colleagues and the management. We launched the service on March 27th,” says Sajeeth Kumar, head of the department. The team has seven psychologists and they provide sessions over phone calls and WhatsApp.

Sajeeth says that he has received nearly 20 calls so far. “The callers come from different backgrounds and most of them are older people who live alone. Some are worried about their health while others are anxious about the safety of their children living elsewhere,” he says. Sajeeth advises people to limit social media activity, eat healthy and sleep for at least eight hours every day. “I also recommend doing exercises and talking to family and friends,” he says. Sajeeth has formed a team with his students to make memes with awareness messages on mental health that they post on their social media pages. “I once got a call at 11:00 pm. The gentleman was worried and couldn’t sleep and I helped him,” he says. Covid Mind Support will offer its service till the pandemic settles down.

The association has volunteers assigned for every district in the state. “We have a WhatsApp group and the decision was taken following a discussion there. There are 120 volunteers across the state and and we formed teams to handle the cases,” says Thamilselvan P, who works as an assistant professor in the department of psychology at PSG College of Arts and Science and is one of the five volunteers from Coimbatore.

Know your anxiety Dr K Selvaraj, Professor of Psychiatry and Chief Psychiatrist, Vazhikatti Mental Health Centre and Research Institute says that he has seen a 20% increase in the number of calls that they have been receiving in the past two weeks. “Since the lockdown, we have started on-call counselling. Many callers complain about being not able to sleep, waking up tired, or experiencing palpitation, dry mouth, churning of stomach, etc. These are all signs of anxiety. This could be due to the worries about their jobs, safety or income,” he says.

He suggests that people who experience any such concerns should consult a psychiatrist. “Also talk about your anxiety to your family members. The emotional and mental support that they can provide is tremendous. Try to involve yourself in physical activities. It helps you calm down and sleep better. It is also best to avoid screen time at least an hour before sleep,” he recommends.

This is not a free service. Call 9842253053 from 9:30 am to 1:30 am to book an appointment.

Tamilselvan gets at least four calls every day and most of them are to address anxiety. “The number is gradually increasing each day. Majority of them have no history of mental illness. I listen to them and suggest ways to modify their negative thoughts,” he says. The service will be provided until the pandemic settles down.

32,1484039967_1484239228,"Virus Outbreak: Singapore defends not closing schools earlier

‘CIRCUIT BREAKER’: Keeping schools open was ‘correct,’ as children do not seem to be as badly affected by the virus as adults, Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung said

Bloomberg





Singapore defended its decision not to close its schools earlier as the city-state goes into a partial lockdown from today to stem the spread of COVID-19.

It was the “correct” move to leave them open, as young people do not seem to be as affected by the virus as adults, while there is no evidence they are vectors of transmission, Singaporean Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung (王乙康) said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.

Shutting the schools now is part of a slew of so-called “circuit breaker” measures to shrink the transmission rate of the virus, he said.

“It was correct to keep schools open, but as of now, I think if we want to do a circuit breaker properly, we should close schools” as well, Ong said.

From this week, Singapore is to shutter its schools as it moves to full home-based learning.

It was one of a handful of regions that had resisted doing so, citing early research that children are not as affected as adults, even when more than 160 countries had already shut their schools.

The decision to suspend schools and also close most workplaces came as confirmed cases of local transmissions and unlinked infections in the city-state have risen in the past few weeks.

As of Monday, Singapore reported a total of 1,375 cases since the outbreak began. On Sunday, the city-state announced 120 new cases, by far its highest single-day tally.

While Ong said that about 65 students have been infected with the virus so far, none of them caught the disease while attending school, but from traveling or from the adult family members in their households.

Schools and some businesses may reopen by May 4 if the circuit breaker measures are successful, he said.

“If we do it right, if everyone cooperates, we should be able to crash the transmission rate,” Ong said. “I really hope we do this successfully, and by the fourth of May, we can reopen some business outlets, we can reopen schools, and life gets back to a certain normalcy again.”

Trade-reliant Singapore is reeling from the impact of the pandemic, with the government predicting a 1 to 4 percent contraction in the economy this year.

That was even before new restrictions on movement begin today.

Ong said the virus has all but forced productivity to come to a halt.

“Activity stops, so the impact on GDP will be tremendous” this month, he said.

On Monday, Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat (王瑞傑) announced the country’s third stimulus package in two months.

Costing S$5.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), it brings the city-state’s total virus relief to almost S$60 billion, or 12 percent of GDP, and includes cash payouts to individuals as well as additional steps to save jobs.

The fiscal measures are meant to help companies survive, ensure they have cash flow and help people to pull through this period, Ong said.

With general elections that must be held by April next year, Ong said there is a “good chance” that Singaporeans might have to go to the polls amid the outbreak.

The government yesterday introduced a bill in parliament, allowing for the implementation of temporary arrangements to ensure the safety of voters, candidates and election officials if elections happen under the current conditions.

“Life still goes on. We still go about our daily lives and democracy still has to go on,” Ong said. “If we can get the virus in control, I think we can still have an election campaign plus voting in a safe way.”","Singapore announced an additional S$5.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) stimulus to save jobs and protect the livelihoods of people amid the spread of , or COVID-19, pandemic.

This is the third stimulus package, which was unveiled by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday, and covers wage subsidies and cash payout.

With the latest announcement, the government's response to COVID-19 will total S$59.9 billion or around 12 percent of GDP. The budget deficit is estimated to rise to 8.9 percent of GDP this year.

The government obtained President's in-principle support for a draw of up to S$17 billion from past reserves to finance its second package.

The central bank had eased its monetary policy last week as the city-state is expected to enter a deep recession due to the interruptions to economic activity caused by the outbreak of COVID-19.

""The primary aim of this Solidarity Budget is to take further steps to save jobs and protect the livelihoods of our people during this temporary period of heightened measures,"" Heng said.

""We will also help businesses preserve their capacity and capabilities, to resume activities when the circuit breaker is lifted,"" he added.

The wage subsidy for all firms was raised to 75 percent of gross monthly wages. The government's wage subsidy applies to 1.9 million local employees.

Further, foreign worker levy for the month of April is waived.

All adult Singaporeans will receive S$300 cash payout on the top of S$300 payment announced earlier.

chandigarh

Updated: Apr 17, 2020 01:55 IST

With the Union health ministry declaring Chandigarh a Covid-19 hotspot (red zone), the UT administration has decided to test all those with Influenza like Illness (ILI) for the virus. Also, the administration decided to start thermal scanning on city’s border of all the people entering the city.

The administration has decided to adopt the testing protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research which was updated on April 9.

UT’s principal secretary, health, Arun Kumar Gupta, said the patients with ILI —a person suffering from fever, cough, sore throat and running nose — will be tested for the virus.

“It is as per the protocol developed by ICMR that persons with ILI should be tested within seven days of developing the illness and it will be adopted in Chandigarh in the same manner,” he said.

Regarding the other condition of ICMR which says that after 7 days of illness, the test should be repeated using anti-body test and if it is negative, it should be reconfirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, he said it will not be required at the moment as they should be able to conduct the test within the 7 days of the illness.

Earlier the protocol for testing involved symptomatic patients who have undertaken an international travel, and the contacts of the confirmed cases. Later, it was extended to patients with severe acute respiratory illness.

PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the tests will conducted as per the policy framed by the UT administration and it will be adopted by all city institutes.

NO FRESH CASE FOR FOUR DAYS

Meanwhile, the city reported no fresh case for the fourth consecutive day, while 17 people of a joint family were quarantined in Sector 15. They are all contacts of the Covid-19 positive cases in Sector 15, Panchkula. Of the 17 people, two have been sampled. Results are awaited.

Meanwhile, the police department has been provided with the 60 thermal scanners for examining people entering the city. In the review meeting, the administration also decided that all the staff of municipal corporation, including vendors, vehicle drivers, sanitation workers etc. must be medically screened, sanitised and provided safety gears.

The permissions granted to all the online home delivery agencies would stand cancelled if they failed to follow similar measures stipulated for the MC staff. Cooked food home delivery services will continue to be banned.

Also, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida held discussion with Punjab and Haryana governments to run their offices in Chandigarh with minimal staff, since the entire city has been declared as hotspot district and is under curfew.

RELAXATIONS CITY SET TO MISS AFTER APRIL 20

From April 20, additional activities will be allowed “to mitigate hardship on the public” in the country except areas under red zone. Chandigarh will miss out on these relaxations:

- Hospitals, nursing home, clinics

- Services provided by self-employed persons, for example electricians, IT engineers, plumbers, motor mechanics and carpenters.

- Production units which require continuous process and their supply chain.

- Manufacturing of IT hardware

The study shows that one-third of the people in India contracted the infection without any contact with the infected person and with no travel history to a foreign nation.

Community transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown or a link in terms of contacts between patients and other people is missing. It refers to the difficulty in grasping the epidemiological link in the community beyond confirmed cases. This is different from the local transmission which means that the source of the infection has been identified within the reporting location (such as within a country, region or city).

According to the ICMR, a total of 5,911 people have been tested who had respiratory diseases but did not have coronavirus. Of these, 102 people were found who had coronavirus and 40 of them had no contact history. Such patients were found in 36 districts spread across 15 states in the country. These states need to be careful

No such case was found initially in this study that took place in March but such cases were found in April. To monitor community transmission in the country, ICMR is conducting tests of people who are not patients of coronavirus but patients of respiratory diseases i.e. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

So far, a total of 1,44,910 samples from 1,30,792 individuals was tested and 5,705 individuals have been confirmed positive among suspected cases and contacts of known positive cases in India. On April 9, till 9 pm (IST), 16,002 samples and of these, 320 were tested positive for coronavirus.

As of April 9, 5,734 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 166 deaths have been reported in the country. 473 persons have been cured or discharged after recovery.

The ICMR has also elaborated on the strategy for testing COVID-19 across the country especially in hotspots and evacuees centres identified by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).

It has directed that in the hotspots, cluster areas, large migration gatherings and evacuees centres, all symptomatic ILI (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose) will have to be tested within seven days of illness (rRT-PCR) and after 7 days of illness, an antibody test (if negative, confirmed by rRT-PCR) will be done.

For the rest of the country, the testing strategy is--all symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days, all symptomatic contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, all symptomatic health care workers, all patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath) and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day five and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.",en,2.538461538,2.173076923,1.211538462,2.403846154,2.807692308,2.5,2.076923077

Sofia (AFP) - Cheerful face masks are helping to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus in Bulgaria thanks to a small company in the capital Sofia.

The masks are printed with owls, dinosaurs, llamas and monkeys and will soon find their way to hundreds of doctors and policemen who are struggling to get their hands on the protective gear.

They're being made by the Angel Baby company, which normally produces sleeping bags for infants and is known for its social responsibility campaigns.

""The idea came to us spontaneously as we got calls from friends asking us to sew them masks,"" co-owner Desislava Yankova told AFP.

""We stopped our usual production of baby sleeping bags for a week and we hope to be able to make about 3,000 masks to send to hospitals and police stations around the country,"" she added.

Angel Baby's previous campaigns have included the ""Sleeping bag on a mission"" -- for every baby sleeping bag sold they donated one to a maternity ward, with more than 6,000 bags given away so far.

They are also giving away the masks for free but warning users that they have not been medically certified, so must be washed daily and ironed at high temperatures.

The company says that the masks given to police and doctors are not intended for use by those in direct contact with coronavirus patients but for others who deal with large numbers of people on a daily basis.","THE EDITOR, Madam:

In light of the coronavirus pandemic, it is my humble opinion that a temporary lockdown of the normal movement of people on this island, save and except for those in the essential services, is particularly important at this point in time.

I believe the relevant authorities dropped the ball by their failure to instruct hundreds of recent arriving airline passengers from COVID-19-affected countries to self-quarantine/stay home for the requisite period of time. I commend them for recognising and acknowledging the error of their ways.

Now, they are correcting their misstep, nearly a week after the fact, by calling up and visiting these persons to instruct them accordingly and, hopefully, to try to retrace their movements after their arrival in Jamaica.

The Government should seriously consider closing down regular activities on the island for even a week to stave off any potential spread from the likely mingling of these recent arrivals.

35,1484039933_1484239244,"The unprecedented reliance on digital products and platforms prompted by the pandemic has boosted Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., in which Naspers has a 31% stake. Naspers unit Prosus NV, which holds the Tencent stake, has gained 17% in Johannesburg this year.

“Tech firms are less affected by the shutdowns, because for some of them business still continues,” said Peter Takaendesa, head of equities at Mergence Investment Managers in Cape Town.

Despite the out-performance, by at least one measure Naspers is trading at an increasing discount. While Tencent has gained 1.7% in dollar terms this year, Naspers has declined 14% as the rand weakened. That has widened Naspers’ discount to its net asset value to 52% as of Tuesday, according to Mike Gresty, a money manager at Johannesburg-based Anchor Capital Ltd.





While narrower than the 55% reached earlier this month, the discount remains “significantly wider than the range it has been historically,” Gresty said. The benchmark index has dropped almost 40% this year in dollar terms.





The sector is benefiting from the current “work from home” environment, but a prolonged outbreak will test investors’ patience, Mergence’s Takaendesa said.





“If this goes on, and we have another two or three months of lockdown, the market will have to come off even more, and tech stocks will not be immune,” he said. “But so far, the sector is proving very resilient.”





BLOOMBERG","Unprecedented demand for online services and entertainment during Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, along with a scramble for haven investments, have helped set South African stocks on course for a record month.

The benchmark index in Johannesburg is up 14% in April as of Wednesday's close, the most in any month since Bloomberg began tracking the gauge in 1995. Global equity markets are rising as investors assess plans by countries to restart activity and amid signs of progress in treating the coronavirus, but South African stocks have outpaced their emerging-market peers.

Naspers [JSE:NPN] has been the biggest contributor to April's gains, with the Cape Town-based tech investor advancing to record highs as it benefits from its 31% stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent. AngloGold Ashanti [JSE:ANG] and Gold Fields are also among leading market drivers as bullion heads for its best month since 2016, thanks to its allure as a store of value.

""The preference for safe havens will remain for extended periods, even with the increase in optimism, as investors try to preserve capital while participating in the upside we're seeing,"" said Lulama Qongqo, an analyst at Mergence Investment Managers in Cape Town.

Naspers, up 14% in April as of Wednesday, accounts for 20% of the main index, with other major contributions this month coming from market heavyweights BHP [JSE:BIL], Anglo American [JSE:AGL] and Richemont [JSE:CFR].

(Seychelles News Agency) - The Seychelles Bankers Association is assisting clients facing financial difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic with two types of support.

The support includes a moratorium on payments and a private-sector relief scheme, an association official, Bernard Jackson, told a news conference on Thursday.

Jackson said a total of 1,145 requests for support have been received by the banks, 800 of which have already been approved. One request has been declined whereas the remaining 344 are still being looked into as some documents still need to be submitted by the clients.

The moratoriums being offered to clients include no interest or capital repayments for a period of six months for businesses or three months for individuals.

""At the end of the respective period we will need to take what the client has not paid and had the client pay it in an increased period of time at the same amount as before the moratorium or increase the amount being paid over the same amount of time,"" he said.

Jackson said the association has worked closely with the Central Bank of Seychelles to put in place a loan ""with really low-interest rates.""

""Those who qualify for this assistance will get a six-month moratorium where they won't be paying anything. These people need to meet some financial commitments such as rentals, communication and maintenance fees as they need to continue paying some essential services,"" said Jackson.

He explained that these clients will be given a maximum of three years to pay off the loan. The banks are taking into account that there are people who will be able to pay in a shorter period and those are welcomed.

The association mentioned that micro, small, and medium enterprises with an annual turnover of less than SCR 25 million ($1.5 million) and self-employed individuals account for most of the requests being made.

To be eligible for the support, the business and personal credit facilities must have been in good order before February 2020.

""We will need to know that you are someone serious and this is a temporary situation. When the situation goes back to normal, they will start to pay normally. People who weren't serious before the crisis do not merit consideration as once the situation goes back to normal, they will be in difficulty again, and we will need to start legal procedures which wastes the banks' time,"" he said.

""Secondly, when we look at the crisis, there is a lot of burden-sharing that needs to take place. The government has put in place economic measures, and the central bank has come with its provisions. We need to take into account if a person has already received assistance from the government before we assist them,"" said Jackson.

Seychelles, a group of 115 islands in the western Indian Ocean, has nine commercial banks.","Isolation. Home quarantine. Social and physical distancing. These were all words with little relevance for most of us before COVID-19, but after the virus arrived in Seychelles, these words became part of our daily vocabulary.

Since March 14, when the first case was confirmed in Seychelles – 115 islands in the western Indian Ocean – strict measures have been taken for containment and prevention of community transmissions.

Restrictions on movement and the closure of schools and non-essential services meant that people needed to stay at home. But how are people coping with home confinement and the extra time to spare?

SNA brings you eight things many people are doing at home to cope with COVID-19.



Do It Yourself

A whole day at home seems to give you plenty of time on your hands to do all those things you didn’t have time to do before. A normal day would have been time spent at the office, at school, doing the shopping, being stuck in traffic and socializing.

But now with time, you find time to do it yourself from sewing to fixing that old creaky chair to making your very own flower pots.

Exercise

Being stuck at home means that you are not walking to work, not rushing to take the bus and not climbing the steps to your second-floor office. And with all gyms and sporting facilities closed, keeping fit seems to be a challenge.

But one needs to exercise and what better way to keep fit than doing exercises in the comfort of your own home.

Arts and craft

Many people are taking this time to rediscover the hidden talents that have been shoved aside and replaced with more official duties. With plenty of time from sunrise to sunset, some people are using the time to get reacquainted with their creative self, from sewing those new curtains you always wanted, to recycling these old tyres into flower pots to painting on glass.

Cooking

A look through social media will show that a lot of people are spending more and more time in the kitchen. From mouthwatering dishes fit for a MasterChef to baking of bread and cakes to more traditional ones – all are being prepared. It looks that everyone now has more time to explore their culinary skills.

These dishes including the recipes are now being shared on social media platforms including two popular ones on Facebook: Ki Menu Tanto and Cook and share.

Music

Yes….mucic, ever wonder how life would be without music? A lot of people are using this time to listen to more music and even discover and appreciate new genres. People who are talented can also take to their instrument for solo jamming sessions.

But others are going live, even whole families have taken to music and songs to send positivity and cheers to the community.

Home improvement

For homeowners, there are always things to do around the home. Whilst people are house proud and want to keep everything in order, being away from home at work means that little time is left for improvement unless the work is contracted out.

Involving a contractor means money out of your pockets, therefore if you can, do it yourself and keep that money in your piggy bank!

Home gardening

It has been a while since you paid heed to the national call to have your own home garden. Planting one now will ensure that you have vegetables and fruits at your fingertips. But it will also mean that that you are contributing to the food and nutrition security of your family but also joining in national efforts.

Working from home

You never knew you had a work-from-home office before. Now many people do! Not only is this ensuring that the country continues to function but also as a mean of ensuring that there is some sort of normality in everyday life.

Some have also taken to social media to mentor others, especially entrepreneurs.

COVID-19 can live in the air up to three hours and on certain surfaces for several days, according to a recent study appearing in “The New England Journal of Medicine.”

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA, and Princeton University conducted the study and penned the conclusion paper.

They sought to examine the stability of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as comparing this particular strain of coronavirus with the similar SARS virus (SARS-CoV-1) that appeared in the early 2000s.

According to the NIH, SARS infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003. No cases have been detected since 2004.

But if the two viruses are so similar, why was SARS so limited in its spread in contrast to COVID-19? The answer may be two-fold.

The study found COVID-19 survived on surfaces longer than SARS.

Scientists could detect COVID-19 in the air up to three hours after it was introduced, up to four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, 48 hours on stainless steel, and up to 72 hours on plastic surfaces.

Source: The New England Journal of Medicine

In addition, the study suggests COVID-19 has greater success in spreading because carriers may be asymptomatic or they may not recognize the symptoms quickly enough.

As always, the NIH and other healthcare professionals are advising the public to develop and maintain good, safe habits to combat the spread of coronavirus:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth

Stay home when you are sick

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe","New York, March 18 (IANS) The virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, which has claimed over 7,000 lives globally, can be stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces, according to a new study.

The researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.

The findings, published in the new England Journal of Medicine, provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects.

According to the researchers, the study information was widely shared during the past two weeks after the researchers placed the contents on a preprint server to quickly share their data with colleagues.

The NIH scientists, from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Montana facility at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, compared how environment affects SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, the virus that causes SARS.

SARS-CoV-1 was eradicated by intensive contact tracing and case isolation measures, and no cases have been detected since 2004. SARS-CoV-1 is the human coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2, according to the study.

In the stability study the two viruses behaved similarly, which unfortunately fails to explain why COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.

The research attempted to mimic virus being deposited from an infected person onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting, such as through coughing or touching objects. The scientists then investigated how long the virus remained infectious on these surfaces.

The findings affirm the guidance from public health professionals to use precautions similar to those for influenza and other respiratory viruses to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick; avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth; staying home when people are sick; covering cough or sneeze with a tissue; and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.

The study was jointly carried out by scientists from the NIH, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Princeton University.

The Worcester curry house, Anarkali Indian Restaurant based in The Tything, was re-inspected by Worcestershire Regulatory Services on January 28.

The city venue was granted with the five-star rating - the highest possible rating - following an independent inspection.

The restaurant manager, Muztaba Ahmed, said: “We did everything we could so we could become a five-star restaurant.

“Business was affected after we got the one-star rating.

""Business went down more than 50 per cent. We were suffering for a bit.

“We are trying our best to serve our customers and maintain the good quality.”

Mr Ahmed added: “They were very happy when they re-inspected us.

“As far as I am aware Anarkali was the first Indian restaurant in Worcester.

“I’d like to say thank you to all the customers who have continued to support us and when we were in crucial need.

“We have had the floods and now the coronavirus, so business has been affected like many others in the city.”

The Indian restaurant, which was founded in 1974, has seen a number of improvements.

The mayor of Worcester, Allah Ditta, visited the restaurant to congratulate staff on their progress.

The curry house was re-inspected on October 30, 2019 after the original damning inspection on October 17 which marked Anarkali as ‘major improvement necessary.’

However, the city council said many of the problems had been sorted by the time the curry house was re-inspected.","– –

A baby boy is feared to be the youngest person in the UK suffering from coronavirus after he was reportedly treated by an infected GP.

The eight-month-old and his mother have been placed into quarantine in their own home after both came into direct contact with the confirmed carrier, the Telegraph reported.

The infant’s father told the paper his son has “all the symptoms” associated with the virus and he is terrified his daughter, four, may also have been infected.

“We’re in hell,” he said. “Completely petrified. My ex-partner keeps breaking down in tears.”

The child, who has a pre-existing lung condition and haemophilia, was examined by one of two Brighton GPs who have tested positive for the virus, known as Covid-19.

The father explained that his former partner had taken the baby to Worthing A&E last Tuesday for a check up.

The family then returned yesterday morning, accompanied by paramedics in full hazmat suits, to be tested for the virus. The results are expected on Friday.

After the tests the man said they were given masks to wear told to self-isolate at home.

“We’re staying in the house and giving the kids Calpol and paracetamol, but nothing's working,” he said.

It comes after Public Health England (PHE) confirmed it had traced and advised all close contacts of the two GPs, including about 12 patients.

Between them, the doctors worked at a nursing home, Worthing A&E and two GP practices.

Staff at the hospital complained they had not been given enough information, with one doctor saying: “I had to go into work this morning knowing someone in A&E had tested positive for coronavirus yet we had been told nothing.""

Deputy chief executive and chief medical officer Dr George Findlay said: “As soon as it was confirmed that a healthcare worker from our A&E department was one of the eight confirmed Coronavirus cases, Public Health England immediately began contacting all patients and staff who came into close contact with them.

“They are now being advised on the precautions they need to take.""

He added: “It’s important to stress that if you do need emergency care, our experienced and skilled staff are here for you.

“But we are asking people to help minimise pressure on A&E services by using alternative options for treatment of non-emergency conditions wherever possible.”

Developments in East Sussex come as news emerges of London's first case of the virus – bringing the UK's total number of infected to nine.

The patient, who is now being treated at a specialist NHS centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ in the capital, contracted Covid-19 in China, England’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty, said.

As with the previously confirmed cases, officials are working to identify recent contacts she had.​

There have been almost 60,000 cases of the virus in China and more than 1,300 deaths.

In the rest of the world more than 400 cases have been confirmed across 24 countries, with two deaths so far confirmed outside the Chinese mainland.","ES News email The latest headlines in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid You already have an account.

Boris Johnson has been moved out of intensive care at St Thomas’ Hospital, Downing Street has said.

The Prime Minister, 55, was moved into the ICU at about 7pm Monday night on the advice of his doctors after he began experiencing breathing difficulties.

But after three nights in intensive care his condition improved enought to be moved back to the ward and he is now in ""extremely good spirits"", Downing Street said.

A spokesman said: ""The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.""

""He is in extremely good spirits.""

Colleagues, MPs and world leaders were quick to congratulate the PM, including US President Donald Trump, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

Mr Trump said: ""Great News: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just been moved out of Intensive Care. Get well Boris!!!""

Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: “So good that the Prime Minister is out of intensive care and on the road to recovery.

""The NHS is there for us all and I know our amazing NHS staff have given him their characteristic world-class care.”

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for the PM said: ""The news we all wanted to hear. Thank you to all the NHS staff helping the country and the PM to beat #coronavirus. Together we can all do our bit by staying home and protecting the NHS #StayHomeSaveLives.""

Meanwhile, his partner Carrie Symonds tweeted a string of clapping emojis as she joined in the Clap For Carers campaign at 8pm.

Her tweet came less than an hour after it was confirmed Mr Johnson had been moved out of intensive care.

New Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also tweeted: “This is good news. I hope it is the beginnings of a speedy recovery.”

The PM being moved from intensive care came after Downing Street said his condition was ""improving"" earlier on Thursday.

40,1484039901_1484239202,"BEIJING, March 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- On March 25, Shandong Linglong Tyre Co., Ltd. donated 300,000 disposable surgical masks, 2,000 sets of medical protective clothing, and 10,000 COVID-19 antibody test kits to the Serbian government through the Embassy of the Republic of Serbia in the People's Republic of China. These medical supplies will arrive in Serbia soon. This is also the first time that Linglong Tire has donated to a country outside of China since the global spread of COVID-19.

On March 30, 2019, the project launch ceremony of Linglong's second overseas manufacturing base, Linglong International Europe D.O.O. Zrenjanin, was held in Serbia successfully. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic also made his appearance at this ceremony and delivered his speech. As an important foreign investment project in Serbia, the completion of this project will offer job opportunities to local people, raise their income and living standards and promote local economic development.

Meanwhile, since the construction of its project in Serbia, Linglong actively fulfills its corporate responsibilities and gives back to the local government and people through the sponsorship of Serbian SuperLiga and Sino-European Chess Elite Tournament in Serbia, which could better strengthen the culture exchanges between China and Serbia and improve Linglong's brand awareness in Serbia.

As a tire maker focusing on its international development, Linglong always actively fulfills its corporate responsibilities to the countries where its overseas manufacturing bases are located. The donation of medical supplies demonstrates Linglong's responsibility to work together with Serbian people to overcome this crisis.

Currently, the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic has come to a critical period. In response to the call of building community with shared future for mankind, Linglong Tire will pay close attention to the global epidemic development and make its contribution to the victory of the battle against the COVID-19.

BELGRADE, April 30. /TASS/. Developing a coronavirus vaccine may turn into an ideological race between the world’s leading powers, says a collective statement of the Belgrade Forum for the World of Equals, an organization of Serbian diplomats, political scientists, and military and medical officers, obtained by TASS Thursday. ""With a few exceptions, humanity did not show any significant feats of solidarity in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, [humanity’s] western part — especially so,"" the statement reads.

The organization’s representatives expressed their concerns that a ""race to find a vaccine"" would begin soon, which may turn into an ideological war. “Those who find the vaccine first, will have more success convincing others that his vaccine is better than [that of] the others."" According to the experts, it is possible that ""propaganda, not the vaccine’s quality, will shape"" the balance of world powers after the pandemic. The Belgrade Forum for the World of Equals is an expert club, created in 2000 that analyses events in Serbia, in the Balkans and throughout the entire world.

This is the message from Concor CEO Lucas Tseki as the country enters an extended lockdown for another two weeks.

“This is an historic challenge facing the planet, and we are all called upon to make our own contribution in these difficult and uncertain times,” Tseki says. “The current crisis highlights more than ever how interconnected we all are – across communities, countries and continents. We are all in this together, and must act responsibly toward a common goal of stemming the spread of the virus.”

He commended President Cyril Ramaphosa “for his grit and courageous leadership in the face of adversity”, noting that the decision to extend the national lockdown could not have been easy. The lockdown’s impact on business was clearly front-of-mind for decision-makers, but the global spread of the deadly virus demanded that tough choices be made.

“For Concor’s executive team, our primary focus at the moment is the group’s sustainability, so we continue to engage our business partners and explore opportunities within the market,” he says. “We are doing everything possible to mitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus including preparation for responsible resumption of operations post the lockdown– and we are confident that together we will weather this unprecedented storm.”

Own Correspondent|The south African president Cyril Ramaphosa seems to be caught up between a rock and a hard place with his attempts to combat the spread of the Corona Virus in South Africa.

Christianity being one of the biggest religions in the country, some of its leaders are showing signs of defiance towards one of the safety measures imposed by the president to help fight against the spread of the virus in the country.

The president advised that people should use elbow salutes instead of hand shakes, and hand sanitizers are also to be issues at public spaces where money or goods may be exchanged by hand.

But the most heat seems to be aimed at the quantity measure by which the president has ordered people to avoid any ensemble that will entail hundred or more characters.

Church leaders say that Ramaphosa isn’t a deity and therefore should not be given the power to halt the masses from going to their churches regardless of the risks that may impose on the entire country.

South African citizens have a constitutional right to go or worship as they please but what’s to be done when that right puts the entire nation in the risk of accelerated spread of the Corona Virus.

Governor Holcomb is ending a six-week stay-home order, and allowing stores, factories and libraries to reopen. The following Monday, restaurants can resume dine-in service, and barbers and hairdressers can reopen.

But the restrictions aren’t being lifted completely. Stores and restaurants will have to limit customers to half capacity, and you’re encouraged to wear a mask if you go out.

The order allows houses of worship to reopen next Friday — all other mass gatherings are limited to 25 people. Bars, gyms and casinos are still closed. Holcomb says if everything goes well, the plan is to go back to normal on the Fourth of July.

But Marion and Lake Counties remain under full lockdown for another week, and Cass County for two weeks. Nearly half the state’s coronavirus cases are in those three counties.

For additional information, visit backontrack.in.gov.","Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb’s plan to reopen Indiana, announced Friday, consists of five stages. Each stage allows different sectors – like retail and entertainment – to open at different times and at different capacity levels. Social gathering allowances increase from 10 to 250 throughout the stages.

Stage 2 starts Monday for most counties. Marion and Lake Counties won’t enter Stage 2 until May 11. Cass County will start Stage 2 on May 18.

By Stage 5, set to begin July 4, fairs, festivals and sporting events can resume, with social distancing guidelines. Retails stores, gyms, personal services and dining establishments can operate at full capacity. Once the state reaches Stage 5, officials will decide how to approach the next school year.

""This could quickly blossom,"" Gen. Joseph Lengyel told Pentagon reporters Thursday.

At the moment, just over 2,000 members of the National Guard are assisting governors in 27 states, doing things such as helping with testing and transportation. Lengyel said that number could double by this weekend.

There are some 450,000 Guardsmen in the Air Guard and National Guard.

Lengyel said he doesn't see the need to federalize the guard, meaning it would come under control of the president. He said it's more efficient to leave it under state control.

On Thursday, President Trump appeared to agree. At a meeting with a group of governors, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia told Trump to ""leave the directives for the National Guard with the governors.""

""That's done. I like it,"" Trump responded.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

We're going to talk now about what the U.S. military can or should do to help the country fight the coronavirus. Defense Secretary Mark Esper says the department is providing millions of protective masks and 2,000 respirators. Military hospital ships are getting ready to sail, and field hospitals are on standby. We've got NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman with us this morning.

Hi, Tom.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel.

MARTIN: So a lot of what's being done now is through the National Guard - right? - since they essentially work for the governors, and they're already living in these communities.

BOWMAN: Yeah, that's right. The head of the National Guard, General Joseph Lengyel, said there are now more than 2,000 guard members helping in 27 states. And, Rachel, he said that 2,000 number will double by the weekend. And he expected tens of thousands of guardsmen to be deployed in the coming weeks and months.

Now, General Lengyel also said he doesn't see the need to federalize the guard - meaning it would come under control of the president. He says the governors have a better sense of how the Guard should be used. So at this point, it's up to each individual state. And one key thing to remember is the federal government - if they assume control of the guard, it would be forbidden to engage in domestic law enforcement.

MARTIN: What is the guard doing right now? And what could they be doing?

BOWMAN: Well, they're doing everything from providing transportation to assisting in testing to medical assistance to helping with planning for the governors. Now, they could also help with police and law enforcement as well. And members of the Tennessee Guard helped in a different way. They recently flew a half-million swabs for coronavirus testing from Italy to Memphis, Tenn., and then they'll be distributed by FedEx. And these swabs will be used in testing, and then the swabs will be sent to labs.

So you could see guard members helping out in that effort - maybe moving these tests from where they were initiated to the labs. Now, we were told yesterday by senior Pentagon health officers that the 15 Pentagon labs could assist in analyzing those swabs. They said that they could do tens of thousands each day - so a significant number.

MARTIN: Tom, what about these huge hospital ships that the military has? We've heard reports that they are going to be deployed in hot zones. They take a long time to move, though, don't they?

BOWMAN: You know, they do. The hospital ship Mercy on the West Coast is expected to get underway as early as Monday. No official word yet where it's going. One official told me Seattle, but California wants the hospital ship, too. And the hospital ship Comfort on the East Coast - it will take weeks to get going because of maintenance and other issues. That ship will head to New York. And each ship, Rachel, has 1,000 beds. And - but they'll not be dealing with coronavirus but taking the pressure off local hospitals by, you know, handling other medical needs.

MARTIN: Right. And, Tom, you're working out of the Pentagon. There are still thousands of people working there, right? I mean...

BOWMAN: Yeah, and almost...

MARTIN: ...Are they all keeping 6 feet away from each other?

BOWMAN: Well, the reporters are keeping six feet away. And everyone around the building - you know, they're doing elbow-to-elbow greetings. And, you know, people are trying to keep their distance when they're walking the hallways. And interestingly, Defense Secretary Esper said he talked with his deputy who works right down the hall by phone rather than going to - having - you know, sitting close to each other. And there are also people with no-touch thermometers testing people around the Pentagon intermittently.

MARTIN: So testing is happening.

BOWMAN: Oh, yeah. Yeah. But kind of, you know, sporadically, you know.

MARTIN: Yeah.

BOWMAN: As people go into the offices, they're testing. And I'm told if you test with above-average temperature, you know, you're told to go home. And it's happened on a number of occasions.

MARTIN: NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman.

Thanks, Tom.

BOWMAN: You're welcome, Rachel. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.","As the United States death toll from coronavirus rose to 14 on Friday, with the total confirmed cases now topping 225, a new investigative report by The Atlantic Monthly finds that very few Americans have been tested for the deadly disease. In a survey of dozens of officials across all 50 states, The Atlantic verified only 1,895 coronavirus tests that have actually been carried out in the country.

Saying that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""got this right"" with previous outbreaks such as the 2009 H1N1 flu virus pandemic and the Zika virus epidemic of 2015 and 2016, the CDC's former director, Thomas Frieden, told the magazine, ""I don't know what went wrong this time.""

Also on Friday, researchers in China — where the outbreak seemingly originated and which has been hit much harder by coronavirus than any other country — said that tests should now include fecal stool samples. According to a report by the medical site Gastroenterology and Endoscopy News, the disease has now been found to infect the digestive tracts of victims and is not confined to the respiratory tract.

The study in China found that more than half of patients tested showed evidence of coronavirus in fecal samples — and about one in four showed the virus in their stool even after respiratory tests proved negative.

Microscopic view of the coronavirus at the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has reportedly overseen deep cuts to the CDC and other government agencies set up to prevent and respond to new outbreaks and epidemics, according to an overview of Trump administration health policies by Mother Jones magazine.

In 2018, the Trump administration slashed 80 percent of CDC funding for fighting global pandemics. Last October, Trump ended the ""Predict"" program, a scientific research project that studied how diseases are transmitted from animals into the human population. Experts suspect that the coronavirus may have originated in bats.

The program ended by Trump was started by President George W. Bush and expanded under the Barack Obama administration until Trump cut it off last year. According to Mother Jones, the ""Predict"" program discovered more than 1,000 new viruses, including one strain of the deadly Ebola virus.

As of earlier this week, South Korea — a country whose population is about one-sixth the size of the U.S. population — had reportedly carried out 65,000 coronavirus tests.

Many European countries have also been testing for the virus at a much higher rate than the United States, according to Mother Jones. The United Kingdom has carried out about 14,000 tests, and the Canadian province of Ontario alone has tested more than 1,100 people for coronavirus.

On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence, who was named by Trump to lead the nation's coronavirus response, said that ""roughly 1.5 million tests"" would be made available this week.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that ""by the end of this week, close to a million tests will be able to be performed,"" as quoted by The Atlantic.

Even with ramped-up testing capabilities, local officials could test at most ""several thousand people a day,"" the magazine reported — well short of the hundreds of thousands promised by the Trump administration.",en,1.333333333,2.020833333,1.25,2.604166667,2.375,2.916666667,2.666666667

The benchmark S&P 500 was pointing to a 5 percent gain ahead of the opening bell and was on track to win back some of its 9.5 percent plunge on Thursday. But that doesn’t mean investors are out of the woods just yet, after having endured a 26.7 percent drop from the Feb. 19 peak.

GOLD DROPS BUT STILL HAS LUSTER LONG TERM

“I wish I could tell you that I see calmer waters in front of us, but I do not,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz Global Investors, told FOX Business’ Liz Claman after Thursday’s closing bell. “Waters are going to get even choppier.""

The turmoil will be driven by the sudden economic disruption from the coronavirus as well as transactions forced by market conditions that haven't been completed yet.

“You have a lot of trapped longs,"" El-Erian said. ""You have a lot of redemptions going on from ETFs and going on from mutual funds. So I'm afraid it's going to get even more treacherous in the next few days and weeks.”

Stock-market bottoms do not happen overnight.

The S&P 500 took 101 trading days to bottom after former President George W. Bush signed the Troubled Asset Relief Program on Oct. 3, 2008, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Along the way, the index staged several double-digit percentage rallies and declines before ultimately putting in a bottom on March 9, 2009, and starting the longest bull market in history.

“This road can be very short if we find a way quickly of containing the virus and of increasing immunity,” El-Erian said. “A vaccine would do it. I don't think, unfortunately, that's going to happen in the next few weeks, so I think we are going to see further economic, financial and technical pressures on markets.”","Global central banks are springing into action to combat the economic slowdown caused by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, but their rate cuts won’t have the intended impact, according to Mohamed El-Erian.

“We are going to get what I call correlated rather than coordinated action, meaning that everybody will be doing something very similar but it’s not coordinated enough,” El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz Global Investors, told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo on Wednesday.

He says central bank interest-rate cuts are “pushing on a string.” El-Erian compared the central bank action to what behavioral scientists call “active inertia,” meaning they are showing that they are doing more to combat the problem, but they are “doing the same thing that doesn’t work.”

OIL CRASH POISED TO SIPHON BANK PROFITS

The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 0.25 percent at an emergency meeting Wednesday, becoming the second major central bank to take such action.

""They understand that it's not enough to cut interest rates, you have to focus on where the pain is,” El-Erian said. Britain's central bank is looking into timely and targeted measures to try and help small- and medium-sized businesses and is also coordinating with Treasury, putting ""major emphasis above and below"" Wednesday's policy action.

He believes the U.S. urgently needs ""a whole of government approach"" that first examines what the most vulnerable parts of society are and where the systemic risk lies, then plays defense on that.

Washington should also play offense by promoting sustainable growth and taking the lead in terms of global coordination, he said.

Earlier on Wednesday, European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde said a failure by the region's leaders to act could produce a ""scenario that will remind many of us of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis,"" according to Bloomberg.

The European Central Bank is scheduled to meet on Thursday, and is widely expected to match the rate cuts made by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England. Policymakers have also been floating the possibility of boosting liquidity and credit, according to Lagarde.",en,2.479166667,2.270833333,1.166666667,2.729166667,2.604166667,1.125,1.208333333
45,1484039981_1484239282,"NEW DELHI : Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan has urged the Narendra Modi administration to prioritize spending on the poor and warned that bad loans could rise due to the coronavirus pandemic, calling it the nation’s “greatest emergency perhaps since Independence"".

Rajan, who is currently professor of finance at Chicago Booth, US, said in a blog post that prioritizing spending on the needy could help them see them through the crisis months ahead. Failure to do so could have consequences, he said, citing the mass movement of migrant labour that has already taken place.

“Another would be people defying the lockdown to get back to work if they cannot survive otherwise. Spending on the needy at this time is a high priority use of resources, the right thing to do as a humane nation, as well as a contributor to the fight against the virus,"" Rajan said in his blog posted on LinkedIn.

The economist, however, said that India cannot, at the same time, lose sight of its financial constraints. Unlike developed economies such as the US or Europe, which can spend 10% of GDP without fear of a ratings downgrade, India has entered this crisis with a huge fiscal deficit, and will have to spend even more, he said.

A ratings downgrade coupled with a loss of investor confidence could lead to a plummeting exchange rate and a dramatic increase in long-term interest rates in and substantial losses for India’s financial institutions, he said.

Many economists have been urging the government to come out with a fiscal stimulus package to salvage the economic growth rate and save jobs, arguing factory closures and a lockdown are set to take a heavy toll on economic growth.

According to Shamika Ravi, director of research at Brookings India, India need not wait any longer before announcing a big fiscal stimulus package. “We should be prepared for a strategy of ‘whatever it takes’ to fight back the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy. That means, we should be having a response that works out to 4-5% of GDP. Our initial response—the welfare package—was very humanitarian in nature. Overall, given the uncertain nature of the pandemic, we will have to frontload the economic response,"" she said. “India cannot afford to wait for long to get clarity on the impact of the pandemic before announcing the economic response.""

Rajan, who had previously served as chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, also warned that bad loans will mount in the banking sector, including in retail loans as unemployment rises.

“The RBI should consider imposing a moratorium on financial institution dividend payments so that they build capital reserves,"" he said.

He suggested that the government accept responsibility for the first loss in incremental bank loans made to small businesses, up to the quantum of income taxes paid by such entities in the previous year. This, Rajan argued, will recognize the likely future contribution of small businesses to the exchequer and reward them with easier access to funds.

He recommended the strong measures as the coronavirus pandemic has affected jobs and businesses in a bigger way than even the shock caused by the global financial crisis of 2008-09. He said that with the right resolve and priorities, however, India could take control over the situation and set the stage for a better future.

The three-week lockdown, he said, is the first step, which buys India time to improve its preparedness. “We should now plan for what happens after the lockdown, if the virus is not defeated. It will be hard to lock down the country entirely for much longer periods, so we should also be thinking of how we can restart certain activities in certain low-infection regions with adequate precautions,"" he said.

Rajan also urged the government to take the support of people with proven expertise and capabilities to manage the situation. “It may even want to reach across the political aisle to draw in members of the opposition who have had experience in previous times of great stress like the global financial crisis,"" he said.","New Delhi: After announcing a 21-day nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to the people not to panic as all essential commodities like medicines and milk would be available during the shutdown.

Soon after his address to the nation, the Prime Minister tweeted: ""My fellow citizens, there is absolutely no need to panic. Essential commodities, medicines etc. would be available. Centre and various state governments will work in close coordination to ensure this. Together, we will fight COVID-19 and create a healthier India.""

In another tweet, Modi said, ""By converging around shops, you are risking the spread of COVID-19. No panic buying please. Please stay indoors. I repeat -- Centre and State Governments will ensure all essentials are available.""

His appeal came after people across the country started thronging the shops to buy essential items in view of the nationwide three-week lockdown starting Tuesday midnight.

Earlier, Modi said in his second special address to the nation within a week, ""With folded hands, I request you to stay put wherever you are.""

He added that he was mindful of the economic ramifications of the decision. Modi warned that if people don't follow a complete lockdown for the coming 21 days, the nation will go back 21 years and many families will be devastated.

He also said many powerful countries in the world have become helpless, regardless of their efforts. He once again reiterated that social distancing was the only way to deal with the dreaded virus that has infected more than 500 people in India so far.

""Some people are under the misconception that social distancing is only for those infected with coronavirus... But they should understand that this is for everyone because it is important to break the cycle,"" Modi said in his address to the nation.

46,1484039983_1484239284,"As expected, the weasel words were not long in following. ""My choice of words was unfortunate,"" he said.

Just when we were asked to support and take care of each other, along comes a minister of government (with responsibility for the economy no less!), to threaten and kick those most vulnerable.

Adding insult to injury, Silvio Schembri described this as charity beginning at home. There was no evidence of charity anywhere.

It is relevant to note that he is an ‘educated’ and privileged member of society, someone who is unlikely to suffer from the economic downturn in any way. And what does he choose to do in parliament, during an important public debate on the coronavirus – he chooses to attack the vulnerable. Unforgivable!

He also runs the risk of undermining the amazing support work currently being done across these islands, much of it by foreigners.

Sadly, it is all too symptomatic of the dishonest and diversionary tactics of very many of our ‘leaders’ over the past decades. Ultimately, the minister must live with his own conscience and with his ‘sense of himself’ when he looks in his many mirrors daily. His choice of words and his framing of them is his responsibility, and one can only hope that others in power let him know in no uncertain terms that he was way out of line. Sowing division while insisting on social solidarity is at best dishonest and at worst devious.

However, the minister’s major sin was to ‘give permission’ for the torrent of abuse, bigotry, prejudice and racism that followed across multiple social media platforms.

No doubt he can claim that he is not responsible for the prejudices of commentators and followers. But I would insist that he knew precisely what he was doing. This was a calculated appeal to a particular gallery and a specific power agenda. One that has and will continue to have consequences for many others, so many of them not remotely as privileged and protected as the good minister.

Silvio Schembri's words in parliament on Tuesday.

As we readily know from history, words have consequences and doing a Pontius Pilate on it at a later date is even more dishonest and duplicitous.

The evidence is there in full public view that the search for ‘scapegoats’ for the many failings of our own society (including in the current coronavirus context) is in full swing. It is clear that many firmly believe ‘foreigners’ are responsible for whatever is the focus of our discussion at any given moment.

The internet is currently brim-full of the most fantastical conspiracy theories and ‘understandings’ and ‘facts’ of the state of our broken world (and the planet). Of course, everyone is entitled to their favourite ‘explanation’ but when our words and theories risk damaging others a line must be drawn.

Our words shape the world in so many ways. Just as our words have the power to heal, offer comfort and security, hope and solidarity, they also have the power to wound, frighten, disempower and alienate. Harping on negatively and ad nauseam about foreigners, Muslims, migrants and ‘spongers’ ensures that we routinely avoid taking responsibility for the mess we have made ourselves.

But, most dangerously of all, it encourages others to attack. Not just verbally, which is unforgivable in itself, but also physically. In the past few weeks alone, we have witnessed physical attacks on Chinese people spurred on by the insistence that this is a ‘Chinese virus’.

The words being shared on much of Maltese social media at the moment are as likely to urge action against ‘foreigners’, as they are to simply offer another theory.

It would be most remiss to not acknowledge the immediate responses to the minister’s threats, not least of all from many business interests which have benefitted from these very same foreigners. The responses of many others on social media also give us space and hope that the ‘other’ Malta is alive and well.

For me, for we are all foreigners, it is time to speak up and speak loudly.","MIRI: Despite the announcement of the movement control order on Tuesday following the spike of Covid-19 cases, some members of the public could still be seen patronising eateries in the city centre yesterday.

A brief check conducted by New Sarawak Tribune on Day One of the order discovered that people were still eating and enjoying their breakfast at eateries. Most were senior citizens.

At Old Folks Street nearby Persiaran Kabor here, dozens of senior citizens were enjoying themselves sitting, chatting and playing traditional Chinese chess, and having breakfast.

47,1484039985_1484239286,"The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), on Monday, stated that the COVID-19 palliative distribution failed to reach the most vulnerable Nigerians who needed them.

It also queried the sincerity in the distribution of the palliatives, implemented by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19.

The Council in a statement issued and signed by its Secretary-General, Almustapha Asuku Abdullahi, in Abuja, argued that the parameters for eligibility for the palliative failed to meet the standard of development experts.

He stressed that COVID-19 response is one that requires a wider and multi-dimensional perspective compared to the approach currently adopted by the Presidential Task Force of COVID-19.

“The leadership of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) wishes to condemn in its entirety the on-going Federal Government palliative on COVID-19 has been implemented by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 most especially through the office Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development.

“The distribution of palliatives by the Federal Government to cushion the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on poor and vulnerable Nigerians in parts of the country has been nothing short of insincerity and confusion as been implemented by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19,” the statement partly read.

While condemning the exclusion of Youth bodies in the PTF, he called for the immediate review of the task force to ensure that youths included in the COVID-19 palliative arrangement.

“Of great concern is the exclusion of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), the Civil Society and other viable Youth Structure most especially the Office of the Special Assistant to the President on Youth & Students Affairs from the COVID-19 Presidential Task Force, where is the sincerity of the Presidential Task Force when they exclude the most vulnerable and most populous segment of the Nation population and not capturing them in the palliative programmes,” it said.

Also, he urged Nigerian youths to abide by the guidelines released by the PTF as the gradual ease of the lockdown takes effect in affected State including the FCT.

He noted that President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to COVID-19 was timely and commendable.

“This decision must be guided and must be all-inclusive and not to be exploited by some of our leaders as means of enriching themselves at the expense of average and vulnerable Nigerian who feels the multiplier effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily basis,” he added.

NIGERIAN TRIBUNE","The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has appealed to the Federal Government to include its members in the palliative measures as they are one of the major groups hit by the tactical shutdown of the economy.

The Council noted that as Nigerians continue to feel the impact of the sit at home order, the Federal Government should include the youths who were never captured amongst the poorest of the poor.

The NYCN in a statement signed by its President, Solomon Adodo, and made available to newsmen also commended the Federal Government for its efforts initiated for the containment of the spread of the dreaded coronavirus disease and the initiative to reach out to poor households amongst other worthy emergency measures to ease the adverse effects the COVID-19 pandemic might have on our dear nation.

Adodo said even though some of the youth had means of survival but the lockdown has impacted on them on account of the fact that their means of survival is mostly on subsistence day to day basis.

The statement which called on youths to cooperate with the government at all levels and comply with constituted authority in our collective national interest further suggested ways of integrating the youths.

“It has become of critical importance that we alert Mr President that the Nigerian youths are the most hard hit by the stay at home directive which triggered a tactical shutdown of the economy.

“These youths were never captured amongst the poorest of the poor on account of the fact that they had means of eking a living for themselves howbeit on a subsistence day to day basis. This is no longer feasible and their lives are now in dire danger.

“This pressed situation might throw up unforeseen vicissitudes of grave implications if nothing is done to avert same. We, therefore, use this medium to make the following urgent demands to Mr President that:

“The Minister of Youth and Sports should be included in the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to enable him coordinate outreach to youths in terms of awareness and welfare.

“There should be an immediate and direct release of relief materials and funds to all the 37 State Chapter Chairmen of the National Youth Council of Nigeria for onward distribution to the Nigerian youths.

“Nigerian youths should be fully and properly integrated into the activities of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for faster and efficient results.

“May we reiterate that Nigerian youths are already dying slowly under the biting pangs of hunger and this must be stopped through proper concerted efforts,” the statement noted.

These cases are “presumptively positive,” meaning they are pending confirmatory testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As of Wednesday at 9 a.m., the Virginia Dept. of Health reports that 44,169 people have been tested.","The Virginia Department of Health has confirmed the first novel coronavirus-related death in Virginia.

According to a statement by the department issued Saturday afternoon, a man in his 70s who contracted COVID-19 through an unknown source died of respiratory failure as a result of the virus.

The patient was in the Peninsula Health District, in the eastern part of the state, which is one of the areas with the most cases in the commonwealth.

“On behalf of the entire Commonwealth, we express our deepest sympathy for the family and loved ones of the patient who died, as well as the families of everyone who has been affected by this outbreak,” said State Health Commissioner M. Norman Oliver, M.D., M.A. “The health of our residents and the community is our top priority, and we will continue working together to care for the patients, protect the safety of health care workers, and protect the people in our Commonwealth.”

The Peninsula Health District has activated its incident management team and is deploying all necessary resources in order to contain the outbreak in the area, according to the Virginia Department of Health. Public health officials are reaching out to all identified contacts of every known COVID-19 case, including the case involving the man's death.

They are interviewing affected people and giving instructions on how to protect themselves and others.

As of Saturday, forty-one patients have tested ""presumptive positive"" or positive for COVID-19 in Virginia.

The Virginia Department of Health has been updating its total number of cases once per day, around noon. On Saturday, the total rose to 41 cases, up from 30 cases on Friday, 17 cases on Thursday and 9 cases on Wednesday.

The total reported by VDH includes both presumptive positive cases – COVID-19 tests that came back positive either at the Virginia state lab or commercial labs but haven't yet been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) – and confirmed positive cases, which have been confirmed by the CDC.

Recent days have brought increased coronavirus testing capacity for Virginia, with the state lab in Richmond receiving more testing kits and many hospitals, including Sentara RMH, gaining access to testing through commercial labs. That means more reported cases were expected as more people gained the ability to be tested.

On Thursday, the first positive test was reported in the Shenandoah Valley for a Harrisonburg patient that had been hospitalized at Sentara RMH after developing pneumonia-like symptoms.

Since then, there have no other confirmed cases in the western part of the state.

The VDH provided the following breakdown of locations for all 41 cases reported as of Saturday: 10 in Fairfax County, 8 in James City County, 7 in Arlington County, 5 in Loudoun County, 3 in Virginia Beach, 2 in Prince William County, 1 in Spotsylvania County, 1 in Prince Edward County, 1 in Hanover County, 1 in Chesterfield County, 1 in Alexandria, and 1 in Harrisonburg.

On the global scale, you can find a map by Johns Hopkins University tracking worldwide confirmed numbers of cases and deaths here.

Governor Ralph Northam issued the following statement in response to the confirmed virus death:

“Pam and I were deeply saddened to learn that a Virginian has died from COVID-19, and we grieve for everyone this virus has touched around the world.

“The health of Virginians and our communities is my most important priority right now. As a Commonwealth, we have taken major, critical steps to stop the spread of COVID- 19. I have declared a state of emergency, closed K-12 schools across the state, restricted visitors at nursing homes and correctional facilities, limited state employee travel, and canceled large events.

“This is a public health crisis—we must all treat it as such.

“Again, I urge Virginians: take this seriously. Take basic health precautions, avoid large gatherings, telework if possible, and stay home if you are sick. That will stop the virus from spreading.

“It is all of our responsibility, yours and mine, to keep each other safe and healthy.

“You deserve to know next steps. I will meet with local officials on the Peninsula tomorrow, and we will speak to the community at 12:00 PM about additional measures we are taking to combat COVID-19.”

What to know about COVID-19

Most people don't suffer much from COVID-19, but it can cause severe illness in the elderly and people with existing health problems.

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can cause mild to more severe respiratory illness. In a small proportion of patients, COVID-19 can cause death, particularly among those who are older or who have chronic medical conditions. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Symptoms appear within 14 days of being exposed to an infectious person. COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

To lower the risk of respiratory germ spread, including COVID-19, the Virginia Department of Health encourages the following effective behaviors:

• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

• Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.

• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

• Stay home when you are sick.

• Avoid contact with sick people.

• Avoid non-essential travel.

49,1484039959_1484239260,"K-Electric says ‘no’ to charging bills in installments, extends due dates for bills bellow Rs4,000

Contrary to a request made by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah in view of the economic pressure on citizens from the coronavirus pandemic and the two-week lockdown that has come into effect in the province today, K-Electric has decided to only extend the due dates of all bills below Rs4,000 till April 10, 2020.

The CM in his lockdown address on Sunday asked the power utility to not collect this month’s bill from consumers whose monthly bills were less than Rs5,000 and charge the amount in installments in the next 10 months.

However, the power utility in a statement said that they would only extend the due dates of all bills below Rs4,000 till April 10, 2020. It also reminded of the provincial and federal governments of its Rs240 billion outstanding bills.

The same instruction was issued by CM Shah to the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) as well. “Consumers whose monthly bill is up to 2,000 should be allowed to pay the amount in 10 installments,” the CM said.

However, the gas company had not issued any statement in this regard till the filing of this story late on Sunday night. The chief minister also said that electricity and gas connections would not be cut off in the next two months. Owners of homes and shops were asked to show flexibility in rent collection.

Shah said he would request the federal government to ensure continuous supplies of gas and fuel to power producers and gas distribution companies.

The KE, in its statement, said it was ensuring business continuity even in these difficult circumstances and had stepped forward to provide relief to customers by ensuring an uninterrupted power supply and exempting critical hospital sites from loadshedding. “The power utility is compelled to emphasise that providing uninterrupted power to Karachi’s citizens is its highest responsibility right now especially as people continue to stay indoors. Discharging this responsibility requires business continuity and the ability to make necessary fuel purchases,” the statement read.

In a time of crisis, the power utility resorted to reminding the provincial and federal governments that for several months the KE’s outstanding dues had ballooned to over Rs240 billion; an unsustainable level which could drastically impact its ability to manage routine operations.

“KE has urgently appealed to both the federal and provincial governments for payments against these outstanding dues so that the power utility can continue service provision,” the statement added.

K-Electric said it would continue to closely monitor the developing situation and remain engaged with relevant authorities to ensure that it could continue to serve its customers and ensure a reliable power supply.","In what could be an alarming development for India, a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has pointed towards a possible community transmission of the coronavirus COVID-19 in the country. The study shows that one-third of the people in India contracted the infection without any contact with the infected person and with no travel history to a foreign nation.

Community transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown or a link in terms of contacts between patients and other people is missing. It refers to the difficulty in grasping the epidemiological link in the community beyond confirmed cases. This is different from the local transmission which means that the source of the infection has been identified within the reporting location (such as within a country, region or city).

According to the ICMR, a total of 5,911 people have been tested who had respiratory diseases but did not have coronavirus. Of these, 102 people were found who had coronavirus and 40 of them had no contact history. Such patients were found in 36 districts spread across 15 states in the country. These states need to be careful

No such case was found initially in this study that took place in March but such cases were found in April. To monitor community transmission in the country, ICMR is conducting tests of people who are not patients of coronavirus but patients of respiratory diseases i.e. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

So far, a total of 1,44,910 samples from 1,30,792 individuals was tested and 5,705 individuals have been confirmed positive among suspected cases and contacts of known positive cases in India. On April 9, till 9 pm (IST), 16,002 samples and of these, 320 were tested positive for coronavirus.

As of April 9, 5,734 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 166 deaths have been reported in the country. 473 persons have been cured or discharged after recovery.

The ICMR has also elaborated on the strategy for testing COVID-19 across the country especially in hotspots and evacuees centres identified by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).

It has directed that in the hotspots, cluster areas, large migration gatherings and evacuees centres, all symptomatic ILI (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose) will have to be tested within seven days of illness (rRT-PCR) and after 7 days of illness, an antibody test (if negative, confirmed by rRT-PCR) will be done.

For the rest of the country, the testing strategy is--all symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days, all symptomatic contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, all symptomatic health care workers, all patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath) and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day five and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.",en,1.045454545,2.068181818,1.090909091,2.727272727,2.522727273,1.522727273,1.409090909
50,1484039963_1484239264,"With Spain one of the country’s hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Barcelona great Andres Iniesta says he is finding it tough to watch events unfold in Europe from his new home in Japan.

Iniesta, who joined Vissel Kobe in 2018 after a trophy laden career at Barcelona, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that while the importance of football was secondary during the health crisis it was frustrating not to be able to play.

Japan’s domestic soccer season has been put on hold during the crisis, with Iniesta remaining in Kobe with his wife and three children.

The 35-year-old, one of the most technically gifted midfielders to play the game, said it was difficult to be away from his wider family and friends back in Spain.

“It is a very difficult situation because you are not there with them, with your loved ones,” he said through a translator.

“You can’t see what is happening on a daily life level so that is difficult but we keep talking on a daily basis, checking in with them and just hoping that the situation gets better.”

The new coronavirus has infected more than 200,000 people in Spain and killed over 20,000. Japan has confirmed more than 11,000 infections of the virus with over 250 deaths.

Having to stay home and being unable to train properly has been a challenge but he is savouring being able to spend more time with his family.

“Right now, I think football becomes a secondary thing,” added Iniesta, who scored the winning goal for Spain in the 2010 World Cup final.

“What is important right now is people’s lives, people’s jobs, trying to move society forward to get out of this situation.

“Having said that, of course as a professional footballer it is difficult to not be able to play football, to not be able to share time with my fans, my team mates.

“I try to focus on the positive things, staying at home I get to spend much more time with my family and with my kids, which normally it is not that easy to do.”

After a 16-year spell at Barcelona that saw him win nine La Liga and four Champions Leagues titles, Iniesta decided to take up a new challenge in the J.League.

His storied career and that move to Japan are the subject of a documentary about his life: ‘Andres Iniesta – The unexpected hero’, which is to be released on Thursday.

Despite winning virtually everything there is to win in Europe, Iniesta has not come to Japan to slide quietly into retirement.

He led Vissel Kobe to their first piece of silverware when they won the Emperor’s Cup in January and is hungry for more success here.

After his playing days are over he says he wants to move into coaching but will take things one step at a time.

“I feel I want to pursue being a coach but we will see what happens, things change on a daily basis so in a few years we don’t know what will happen,” he said.

“For now, I am focusing on what I have in front of me.”

When football is given the green light to resume Iniesta wants to pick up where he left off, imparting his wisdom to Kobe’s younger players and aiming for a first J.League championship.

The J.League have said it would be May at the earliest when matches can return.

“I want to share my experience with the young players. I think it is my responsibility too and it forms part of the big project I came here for,” said Iniesta.

“I like to talk with them, share things with them and I also like the feeling that they can ask me questions and they are learning stuff.”","Jan Vertonghen has hinted for the first time he will leave Tottenham Hotspur when his contract expires.

The 33-year-old defender’s current deal expires in the summer, though there is still doubt about what will happen if the Premier League season extends beyond June 30.

Spurs boss Jose Mourinho was keen for Vertonghen to stay, but suggested the defender’s agent was playing hardball over a fresh contract.

Vertonghen, who joined Spurs in 2012, has not ruled out staying in north London, but has suggested he would like to play in Italy or Spain and has said there have been “serious” offers for him.

“I want to sign with the right club. It could be Spurs, or another club,” he told Belgian TV channel Play Sports. “I really want to continue at top level for a few more years and I would like to play European football next season.

“Since January, a number of clubs have come forward with serious proposals. The Spanish and Italian leagues are the most obvious for the time being, but I will keep all options open.”

The Belgium defender, who has been in and out of the team this season, has revealed he finds himself in a stronger position because of the affect the coronavirus could have on the game.

He added: “I’m free, of course, and many clubs don’t have the money to do transfers. Transfer-free players like me are even more coveted in the coronavirus crisis.”

The Premier League are still working out a way to end the season, with some leagues around Europe beginning to accept defeat in their bid to complete the campaign.

A centralised camp to play all of the games in several weeks is just one suggestion which has been mooted, but Vertonghen says that would be “dramatic”.

“They will do everything to finish the competition and people are even considering quarantining the players, coaches and referees for five weeks,” he said. “So a kind of mini-World Cup. That would be dramatic for a family man like me. But we players have little say about that. Money talks.”
